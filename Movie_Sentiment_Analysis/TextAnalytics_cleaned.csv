one of the other reviewer have mention that after watch just oz episode youll be hook they be right a this be exactly what happen with me.the first thing that strike me about oz be it utality and unflinching scene of violence which set in right from the word go trust me this be not a show for the faint hearted or timid this show pull no punch with regard to drug sex or violence it be hardcore in the classic use of the word.it be call oz a that be the nickname give to the oswald maximum security state penitentary it focus mainly on emerald city an experimental section of the prison where all the cell have glass front and face inwards so privacy be not high on the agenda em city be home to many .. aryan muslim gangstas latinos christian italian irish and more .... so scuffles death stare dodgy dealing and shady agreement be never far away.i would say the main appeal of the show be due to the fact that it go where other show wouldnt dare forget pretty picture paint for mainstream audience forget charm forget romance ... oz doesnt mess around the first episode i ever saw strike me a so nasty it be surreal i couldnt say i be ready for it but a i watch more i develop a taste for oz and get accustom to the high level of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crook guard wholl be sell out for a nickel inmates wholl kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmate be turn into prison bitch due to their lack of street skill or prison experience watch oz you may become comfortable with what be uncomfortable view .... thats if you can get in touch with your darker side,negative
a wonderful little production the filming technique be very unassuming very oldtimebbc fashion and give a comforting and sometimes discomforting sense of realism to the entire piece the actor be extremely well choose michael sheen not only have get all the polari but he have all the voice down pat too you can truly see the seamless edit guide by the reference to williams diary entry not only be it well worth the watching but it be a terrificly write and perform piece a masterful production about one of the great master of comedy and his life the realism really come home with the little thing the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream technique remain solid then disappear it play on our knowledge and our sens particularly with the scene concern orton and halliwell and the set particularly of their flat with halliwells mural decorate every surface be terribly well do,positive
i think this be a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sit in the air condition theater and watch a lighthearted comedy the plot be simplistic but the dialogue be witty and the character be likable even the well ead suspect serial killer while some may be disappoint when they realize this be not match point risk addiction i think it be proof that woody allen be still fully in control of the style many of u have grow to love.this be the most id laugh at one of woodys comedy in year dare i say a decade while ive never be impress with scarlet johanson in this she manage to tone down her sexy image and jump right into a average but spirited young woman.this may not be the crown jewel of his career but it be witty than devil wear prada and more interesting than superman a great comedy to go see with friend,positive

petter matteis love in the time of money be a visually stunning film to watch mr. mattei offer u a vivid portrait about human relation this be a movie that seem to be tell u what money power and success do to people in the different situation we encounter this be a variation on the arthur schnitzlers play about the same theme the director transfer the action to the present time new york where all these different character meet and connect each one be connect in one way or another to the next person but no one seem to know the previous point of contact stylishly the film have a sophisticated luxurious look we be take to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.the only thing one get out of all these soul in the picture be the different stage of loneliness each one inhabit a big city be not exactly the best place in which human relation find sincere fulfillment a one discerns be the case with most of the people we encounter.the act be good under mr. matteis direction steve buscemi rosario dawson carol kane michael imperioli adrian grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these character come alive.we wish mr. mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work,positive

phil the alien be one of those quirky film where the humour be base around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines.at first it be very odd and pretty funny but a the movie progress i didnt find the joke or oddness funny anymore.its a low budget film thats never a problem in itself there be some pretty interesting character but eventually i just lose interest.i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who be currently partaking.for something similar but good try brother from another planet,positive
i saw this movie when i be about when it come out i recall the scary scene be the big bird eat men dangle helplessly from parachute right out of the air the horror the horror.as a young kid go to these cheesy b film on saturday afternoon i still be tire of the formula for these monster type movie that usually include the hero a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster die in the end i didnt care much for the romantic angle a a year old and the predictable plot i love them now for the unintentional humor.but about a year or so later i saw psycho when it come out and i love that the star janet leigh be bump off early in the film i sit up and take notice at that point since screenwriter be make up the story make it up to be as scary a possible and not from a wellworn formula there be no rule,neutral

some film just simply should not be remake this be one of them in and of itself it be not a bad film but it fail to capture the flavor and the terror of the film of the same title liam neeson be excellent a he always be and most of the cast hold up with the exception of owen wilson who just do not ing the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version be that it stray too far from the shirley jackson story in it attempt to be grandiose and lose some of the thrill of the early film in a trade off for snazzy special effect again i will say that in and of itself it be not a bad film but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the old version much more,negative

an awful film it must have be up against some real stinker to be nominate for the golden globe theyve take the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangle it beyond recognition my complaint be not that theyve take liberty with the fact if the story be good that would perfectly fine but it simply bizarre by all account the true story of this artist would have make for a far good film so why do they come up with this dishwaterdull script i suppose there werent enough naked people in the factual version it hurriedly cap off in the end with a summary of the artist life we could have save ourselves a couple of hour if theyd favor the rest of the film with same evity,positive
after the success of die hard and it sequel it no surprise really that in the s a glut of die hard on a ..... movie cash in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept that be what they do with cliffhanger die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly stop or my mom will shoot stallones career.cliffhanger be one big nitpicker dream especially to those who be expert at mountain climb basejumping aviation facial expression act skill all in all it full of excuse to dismiss the film a one overblown pile of junk stallone even manage to get outacted by a horse however if you an forget all the nonsense it actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that deliver a plenty of thrill and unintentionally plenty of laughs.youve get to love john lithgows sneery evilness his tick every box band of baddie and best of all the permanently harass and hapless turncoat agent rex linn a travers.he may of be henry in portrait of a serial killer but michael rooker be noteworthy for a cringeworthy performance a hal he insist on constantly shriek in painful disbelief at his captor that man never hurt anybody and whilst he surely cant be it really do look like ralph waite frank character be grin a the girl plummet to her death.mention too must go to former london burn actor craig fairass a the brit bad guy who come a cropper whilst use hal a a human football yes you cant help enjoy that bit hal need a good kicking.so forget your good judgement who care if that could never happen low your acting expectation turn up the volume and enjoy and if youre look for qaulen he the one wear the helicopter,positive

the cell be an exotic masterpiece a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very talented director this be conclusive evidence of what can be achieve if human being unleash their uninhibited imagination this be boldness at work push aside thought to fall into formula and cliche and create something truly magnificent this be the best movie of the year to date.ive read numerous complaint about this film anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast character and bad act to negatively criticize this film be to miss the point this movie may be a landmark a tradition where future movie will hopefully follow the cell have just open the door to another world of imagination so can we slam the door in it face and tell it and it director tarsem singh that we dont want any more personally i would more than welcome another movie by tarsem and would love to see someone try to challenge him.weve all heard talk about go inside the mind of a serial killer and yes i do agree that the genre be a bit overwork the s be full of movie try to depict what make serial killer tick some of them work but most failed but the cell do not blaze down the same trail we be give a new twist we be physically transport into the mind and present with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.i like how the movie do not bog u down with too much scientific jargon try to explain how jennifer lopez actually get to enter the ain of another instead she just lie down on a laboratory table and be wrap with what look like really long twizzlers and jaunt into another entity the cell want to let you see what it all about and not how it all about and i guess thats what some people dont like true i do like explanation with my movie but when a movie venture onto new ground you must let it do what it desire and simply take it in.i notice how the film be very dark when it show reality maybe to contrast the ight visuals when inside the ain of another nonetheless the set design be simply astonish i wouldnt be surprise if this film take home a few oscar in cinematography best costume best director and the like if it be up to me itd at least get nominate for best picture.ive notice that ive kind of be repeat myself not because there nothing else to say but because i cant stress enough how fantastic i think the cell be if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it take over with wonder and an eyepopping feast then you be assure a good time i guess this film be just a little too much for some people write it off a weird or crazy i be very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind so it be right down my alley leave the theater i hear one audience member say whoever make that movie sure do a lot of good drug if so i want what he be smoke out of,positive
this film try to be too many thing all at once sting political satire hollywood blockbuster sappy romantic comedy family value promo ... the list go on and on it fail miserably at all of them but there be enough interest to keep me from turn it off until the end.although i appreciate the spirit behind war inc. it depress me to see such a clumsy effort especially when it will be take by it target to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique rather than simply the poor writing direction and production of this particular film.there be a critique to be make about the corporatization of war but poke fun at it in this way diminish the true atrocity of what be happen reminds me a bit of three king which similarly trivialize a genuine cause for concern,negative
this movie be so frustrating everything seem energetic and i be totally prepared to have a good time i at least thought id be able to stand it but i be wrong first the weird loop it be like watch americas funny home video the damn parent i hat them so much the stereotypical latino family i need to speak with the person responsible for this we need to have a talk that little girl who be always hang on someone i just hat her and have to mention it now the final scene transcends i must say it so gloriously bad and full of badness that it be a movie of it own what crappy dance horrible and beautiful at once,negative
war movie be a hollywood genre that have be do and redo so many time that clichã©d dialogue rehash plot and overthetop action sequence seem unavoidable for any conflict deal with largescale combat once in a while however a war movie come along that go against the grain and ings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen the civil warera cold mountain star jude law nicole kidman and renã©e zellweger be such a film.then again call cold mountain a war movie be not entirely accurate true enough the film open with a quite literally quickanddirty battle sequence that put glory director edward zwick shame however cold mountain be not so much about the civil war itself a it be about the period and the people of the time the story center around disgruntled confederate soldier inman play by jude law who become disgust with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he leave behind ada monroe play by nicole kidman at first glance this setup appear formulaic a the romantic interest back home give the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier tribulation on the battlefield indeed the early segment of the film be relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.cold mountain soon take a drastic turn though a the intrepid hero inman turn out to be a deserter incidentally save the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of want to root for the confederate and begin a long odyssey homeward meanwhile back at the farm ada culture way prove of little use in the field soon she be transform into something of a wilderbeast come to adas rescue be the course toughasnails ruby thewes play by renã©e zellweger who help ada put the farm back together and perhaps more importantly cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seem to have ought upon ada.within these two setting a vivid compelling and at time very disturb portrait of the wartorn south unfolds the character with whom inman and ada interact be surprisingly complex enhance by wonderful performance of brendan gleeson a ruby deadbeat father ray winstone a an unrepentant southern lawman and natalie portman a a deeply troubled and isolated young mother all have be greatly affected and change by the war of northern aggression mostly for the bad the dark pervade antiwar message accent by an effective haunting score and chillingly beautiful shot of virginia and north carolina be communicate to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scene a by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war be fight though the weapon and tactic of war itself have change much in the past century it hellish effect on the land be timelessly relevant.director anthony minghella manage to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film but the atmosphere be unfortunately denigrate by a rather tepid climax that do little justice to the wonderfully form character the love story between inman and ada be awkwardly tack onto the beginning and end of the film though the inherently distant abstract and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fit the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.make no mistake cold mountain have neither the trait of a feelgood romance nor an inspiring war drama it be a unique vision of an era that be sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the life of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of it terrible repercussion altogether,negative

i watch this film not really expect much i get it in a pack of film all of which be pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect and you know what i be right they be all terrible this movie have a few and a few be stretch it interesting point the occasional camcorder view be a nice touch the drummer be very like a drummer i.e damn annoying and well thats about it actually the problem be that it just so boring in what i can only assume be an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it do it utterly tedious i have my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but give it a go and seriously be the lead singer of the band that great look coz they dont half mention how beautiful he be a hell of a lot i think he look a bit like a meercat all this and i havent even mention the killer im not even gon na go into it it just not worth explain anyway as far a im concern star and london be just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london who be actually quite funny it wasnt because of their acting talent ive certainly see a lot bad but ive also see a lot well best avoid unless your bored of watch paint dry,positive
i buy this film at blockbuster for because it sound interest a bit ranmaesque with the idea of someone drag around a skeleton because there be a cute girl in a miniskirt on the back and because there be a restricted viewing sticker on it i think it be go to be a sweet or at least sincere come of age story with a weird indie edge i be wrong.having watch it i have to wonder how it get the restrict sticker since there be hardly any foul language little violence and the close thing to nudity honestly i dont usually go around hop for it be when the girl be in her nightgown and you see her panty you see her panty a lot in this movie because no matter what shes wear a miniskirt of some sort even the antireligious humor be tame and lame caricature insincere derivative unoriginal and bad of all not funny in the slightestit would be well just to listen to ray stevens would jesus wear a rolex on his television show this would barely qualify a pg it be not rat but blockbuster refuse to let anyone under the age of rent thisas if it be pornographic any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of requiem for a dream but they insist that zack and reba be worse.it be but not in that way.in a way this worry methe only thing leave that could offend people be the idea of the suicide at the beginning if anybody need to see movie with honestly portray suicides not this one but good one like the virgin suicides it teenager if both of those movie be rat r purely because of the suicide aspect then i have little chance of turn a story ive be write into a pg movie the main character be eleven and a half and twelve suicide be one of the top three lead cause of death in teenager i think it number so chance be that most teen have be or will be affect by it.just say no to this movie though,negative

ever watch a movie that lose the plot well this didnt even really have one to begin with.where to begin the achingly tedious scene of our heroine sit around the house with actually no sense of menace or even forebode create even during the apparently constant thunderstorm that be strangely never actually hear in the housegreat double glaze the house that be apparently only a few mile from a town yet be several hour walk away or the third girl who serve no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just a the tedium become unbearable or even the beginning which suggest a spate of killing throughout the area even though it be apparent the killer never venture far from the house or the bizarre ritual with the salt pepper that pretty much sum up most of the film inherent lack of direction.add a lead actress who cant act but at least be willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scene and this video be truly nasty but not in the way you hope.given a following simply for be ban in the uk in the s mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder it offer nothing but curiosity value and one classic daft murder dont worryits telegraph at least ten minute before .after a walk in the wood our victim come to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up halfway through they see a figure at the top dress in black and andishing a large scythe what do they do slide down and run like the rest of u no of course not they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon.it really be only a movie a they say ..,negative

after sit through this pile of dung my husband and i wonder whether it be actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie it be that listless and formulaic but the u.s. propaganda throw in your face throughout the film provesdisappointinglythat it the work of human call me a conspiracy theorist but quote like we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it seem like way to justify action like the invasion of iraq etc the fact that nicholas cage spews line like i would never use the declaration of independence a a bargaining chip with a straight face make me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast take valium before shoot each scene the reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue be truly ridiculous and impossible to follow and there also a bonus side plot of misogyny with dr. whateverhernamewas be chide by all involve for never shut up shes clearly in the movie only for look but they felt the need to slap a dr. title on her character to give her some gravity at one point cage character say dont you ever shut up and the camera pan to her look poutily down at her hand like shes a child truly grotesque the only benefit to this movie be that it so astonishingly bad you do get a few laugh out of it the really scary thing be that a majority of the people watch the movie with u seem to enjoy it creepy ....,positive
it have all the clichã©s of movie of this type and no substance the plot go nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watch it the production be good however the script and act be bmovie quality the casting be poor because there be good actor mix in with crumby actor the good actor didnt hold their own nor do they lift up the others this movie be not worthy of more word but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten line james wood and cuba gooding jr. play caricature of themselves in other movie if you be look for mindless entertainment i still wouldnt recommend this movie,neutral

i have hear good thing about state of grace and come in with an open mind i think that god army be okay and i think that maybe dutcher have improve and mature a a filmmaker the film begin with some shaky acting and i think well maybe it will get well unfortunately it never do the picture start out by introduce two elder mormon missionary and it seem that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them instead the story degenerate into a highly improbable series of unfortunate event highlight blatant disobedience by the missionary something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays and it become almost laughable.dutchers only success in this movie be his successful alienation of his target audience by unrealistically and inaccurately portray the life of mormon missionary dutcher accomplishes nothing more than anger his predominantly mormon audience the film in no way reflect reality mission be nothing like what dutcher show have serve a mormon mission myself i can attest to this fact and gang life in california certainly contain much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity.the conclusion which im assume be suppose to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness be available to all be both unbelievable cmon the entire mission gather to see this elder send home and the mom and the girl be stand right next to each other and cheesy next time dutch try make a movie that someone can identify with,positive

a a disclaimer ive see the movie time in the last year and i only just saw the musical this week this allow me to judge the movie without be taint by what be or wasnt in the musical however it taint me when i watch the musical i actually believe michael douglas work quite well in that role along with kasey i think her let me dance for you scene be one of the best part of the movie a worthwhile addition compare to the musical the dancer and sing in the movie be much superior to the musical as well a the cast which be at least time big easy to do in the movie of course the decor light dancing and singing be also much superior in the movie which should be expect and be indeed deliver the song that be in common with the musical be well do in the movie the new one be quite good one and the whole movie just deliver more than the musical in my opinion especially compare to a musical which have few decor the one bad point on the movie be the obvious cut between the actor talk and dubbed singer during the singing portion for some of the character but their dancing be impeccable and the end product be more enjoyable than the musical,positive

preston sturgis the power and the glory be unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty year until the late s when it resurface and even show up on television in the meantime it have gain in notoriety because pauline kaels the citizen kane book have suggest that the herman mankiewicz orson welles screenplay for kane be base on sturgis screenplay here as be mention in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site kael overstate her case.there be about six narrator who take turn deal with the life of charles foster kane the newsreel represent ralston the henry luce clone thatcher memoirs bernstein jed leland susan alexander kane and raymond the butler each have his or her different slant on kane reflect their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man and of course each also reveal his or her own failing when they be tell their version of kanes story this method also lead to frequent overlap retellings of the same incident.this be not the situation in the power and the glory yes like kane it be about a legendary business leader here it be tom garner spencer tracy a man who rise from the bottom to be head of the most successful railroad system in the country but there be only two narrator they be garner right hand man henry ralph morgan and his wife sarah padden this restrict the nearly three dimensional view we get at time of kane in garner henry when he narrate be talk about his bos and friend whom he respect and love his wife be like the voice of the skeptical public she see only the flaw in henry.typical example although he work his way up tom become more and more antilabor in his late year union be troublemaker and he do not care to be slow down by their shenanigan henry describes tom confrontation with the union in a major walkout and how it preoccupy him to the detriment of his home life but henrys wife remind him how tom use scab and violence to end the strike apparently blow up the union headquarters kill many people so we have two view of the man but one be pure white and one be pure black.im not really knock the power and the glory for not duplicate kanes success few film do include all of orson welles other film but i be aware that the story be present well enough to hold one interest to the end and thanks to the performance of tracy and colleen moore a his wife sally the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair be fully ought home.when they marry tom want to do well in part to give his wife and their family the benefit he never have but in america great business success come at a cost tom get deeply involved with run the railroad empire he expand it and improve it constantly but it take him away from home too much and he lose touch with sally and he also notice eve helen vinson the young woman who become his mistress when sally learn of his unfaithful behavior it destroy her.similarly tom too get a full shock which make him a martyr in the eye of henry eve marries tom and present him with a son but it turn out to be eve son by tom son tom jr. philip trent the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding cause tom to shoot himself.the film be not a total success the action jump at time unconvincingly yet it do make the business seem real note the scene when tom tell his board of director about his plan to purchase a small rival train line and he discuss the use of debenture for finance the plan sturgis come from a wealthy background so he could ing in this type of detail so on the whole it be a first rate film no citizen kane perhaps but of interest to movie lover a an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america,negative

i just watch the dresser this evening have only see it once before about a dozen year ago.its not a big movie and doesnt try to make a big splash but my god the illiance of the two lead leaf me just about speechless albert finney and tom courtenay be nothing less than amaze in this movie.the dresser be the story of sir an age shakespearean actor finney and his dresser norman courtenay sort of a valet put on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii these be two men each dependent upon the other sir be almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole wheedle and bully him into get onstage for his th performance of lear and norman live his life vicariously through sir without sir to need him he be nothing or think he be anyway.this be a characterdriven film the plot be secondary to the interaction of the character and a such it require actor of the high caliber to ing it to life finney only year old be completely believable a a very old very sick petulant bullying but illiant stage actor he hiss and fume at his fellow actor even when theyre take their bow and courtenay be no less convincing a the mince dresser who must sometimes act more a a mother than a a valet to his elderly employer employer be really the wrong term to use though for although technically their relationship be that of employer and employee most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much a an old married couple.yes there be others in the cast of this movie but there be no question that the true star be finney courtenay and the marvelous script by ronald harwood that be not to say that there arent other fine performance most notably eileen atkins a the longsuffering stage manager madge there be a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desire old regret and what might have been.although it doesnt get talk about these day it be worth remember that the dresser be nominate for five academy award best actor nomination for both finney and courtenay best picture best director peter yates and best adapt screenplay.i have remember this a be a good movie but i wasnt prepare to be a completely mesmerize a i be from begin to end if you want to see an example of what great acting be all about and be hugely entertain all the while then i encourage you to see the dresser,positive
what happen what we have here be basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie lose it actually it never really get go there be a little excitement when we find out that angie be not really pregnant then find out that she be after all but that be it steve martin who be a very talented person and usually ings a lot to a movie be dreadful and his entire character be not even close to be important to this movie other than to make it long i really would have like to see more interaction between the main character kate and angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it be not but maybe a drama with comedic element i think if the movie do this it could have be very funny since both actress be quite funny in their own way and sit here i can think of numerous scenario that would have be a riot,positive
ive just watch fingersmith and im stun to see the average rating for the show.not only be the plot be difficult to follow but it seem character development be randomly applied.the actor be adequate but in the process of attempt to create twist and turn their character be render entirely one dimensional once this happen the story really fall flat and become tedious.and just in case anyone didnt see the predictable lesbian undertone from mile way this be hammer home in the most banal term at the end of the film.the end scene be disappointing and phone in and anyone who sit back and go ohhh so they be carpet muncher all along must have be out for the evening.two star for the tonsil hockey in the early scene which be at least a bit raunchy none for the rest of it ...,negative
so let begin the movie itself be as original a cronenbergs movie would usually appear ... my intention to see it be certainly jjl be one of my favourite actress she be as lovely a usual this cutie i would not say it be my favourite movie of hers still it quite interesting and entertain to follow the rest of the cast be not extremely impressive but it be not some kind of a miscast star array recommend with confidence,positive

im not sure why the producer need to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggest that it be a sequel to the first three movie .. which it be not even though marque houston do appear in hp he play a totally different character he be eight year old in this film okay ... so reid and martin werent the most talented and couldnt carry a film all by themselves .. but to trade on the hp franchise seem to me that there could have make some sort of reference albeit minor to the early movie im sure everyone who want to see it be hoodwinkedinto thinking that they be see a sequelnot a totally different film with a familiar name and im sorry ... kym whitley be not funny and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris ketty lester or dc curry in the early film although meagen good and mari morrow be a substantial visual diversion ... i have to give this a thumbs down just name the film down to the last minute would have be ok. furthermore the hudlin others who produce the first three movie be not involve in the making of this film,positive
this film labour along with some of the most predictable story line and shallow character ever see the writer obviously buy the playbook how to write a space disaster movie and follow it play by play in particular the stereotypical use of astronaut talk to their love one from out space put on a ave show in the face of disaster have be do time and time again.max q appear to have be write in the hope that the producer would throw million at the project but judging by the latter half of the film which contain numerous lame attempt at special effect the producer could only muster thousand to learn that the film be nominate for a special visual effect emmy have me absolutely gobsmacked.i think a handful of high school student with a pas in medium study could have create more believable effect and the plot hole be too numerous to mention but i will pick one out a an example now im no nasa expert but surely it highly implausible that a worker attach to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when thing start to go pearshaped with the program surely there be someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twentynine year old who have not be in the control room before.the only save grace for this film be the work of bill campbell he manage to make a good attempt at salvage something out of the train wreck that be this script.i give this film out of with the aboveaverage work of bill campbell in the lead role save it from a low mark,positive
caddyshack two be a good movie by itself but compare to the original it cant stack up robert stack be a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield ty webb be funny be the only character from the original most of the other character in the movie lack the punch of the original henry wilcoxon for example except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt be play by randy quaid every line he say remind me of the original humor especially the scene at his office i dont go in for law suit or motion i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f ing baseball bat make a bonfire with the chippindalemaybe roast that golden retriever arff arff arff then eat it and then im comin upstairs junior and im grab you by your ooks others pjs and cram your and new bmw up your tight a do we have an understanding offset his small role however be dan acroyd who be obviously no replacement for bill murray his voice be beyond irritate and everything he do isnt even funny it just stupid overall caddyshack ii be a good movie but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it,positive

maybe it be the title or the trailer certainly not the interview on the dvd which be with the director a he keep say hi kid into the camera like a buffoon but i have expectation for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scene and utal bloody killing by a weird japanese penetrator turn out it way too sleazy for it own good or bad or whatever theres a problem and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust similar to this in many respect in not have balance to the sex and violence too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movie and with the kill scene there have to be at least a little tack and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity in create the creature/killer/whatever entrails of a virgin have neither it safe to say it a pretty soulless movie even if isnt one of the very bad ever make it there just for horndog japanese fetishist to get off on girl in trouble and men who have all their ains in their other heads.in this case be give a photo team where the guy be take some shot of some girl nothing too salacious and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and be pick off one by one by a murderer a he credit first off the director kazuo gaira komizu decide he have to put in a quota of random sex scene early on we get splice in or phone in take your pick clip of one of the photographer have sex with one or more of the girl elsewhere it look like it from another movie then once settle into the house theres a wrestling scene thats poorly choreograph and shot yeah we really need to see him all there and then on to the rape and killing first the rape by the photographer who promise the girl some job for their time then the murderer who like damatos creature be simply cover in mud and give a stupid facial and who for an unknown reason kill the men and/or rap the woman one by one.now the latter of those take by themselves should be consider the highlight of the movie this be like say however that the croã » ton be the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad an eyegouging scene a spike thrown like an olympic event that scene actually be kind of cool and finally the entrailing of the overly sexcrazed girl whose inconsequential name i cant remember even this become disappointing just by not be correct to the title on top of this the sex scene which become tedious through gaira and his indulgence in longtakeswithoutcutaways where everything by the japanese censor be blur anyway be dub over by the actor youd think that they seem to be enjoy themselves enough hence the need to let them speak for themselves but the overall feeling from entrails of a virgin be that of a lumpy one where it just there to be gawk at and without a shred of suspense or true horror watch a the last girl leave alive the virgin of the picture try to stop the murderer from get to her which last five minute a she keep throw stick at him you just want it to be do with for the i hate woman mantra to ease up or be rid altogether,negative

fate lead walter sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that have eerie similarity and connection to his life all base around the number a the story unfolds in real life and fiction sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.the number offer an intriguing premise that be undone by a weak execution the film just fail on many different level which be pretty disappointing because it hold so much potential the screenplay be probably the bad part about it it be fill with silly sequence and laughable dialog that just kill the mood of the movie it seem like the screenwriter have a good idea he just didnt know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute run time the second half of the film be run low on idea the twist be pretty obvious and the end be awful.joel schumacher be responsible for one of the bad movie ever and he do redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other film but the number remind me that he still capable of make a stinker he have the movie drench in style but he just cant get a good focus he move the film at a clunky and slow pace he switch from reality to whats actually happen in the book which quickly get annoy the actual book in the film thats title the number be an awful detective story and the audience get stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bore me to tear when carrey be finally do with book we get stuck watch him run around try to solve the mystery at this point the audience have lose interest and there be no real tension we impatiently wait for the movie to reach it horrible end and unconvincing explanation before celeating that film have finally finished.the acting be mostly average and pretty forgettable jim carrey be clearly just sleepwalk through his performance and he didnt even seem to be try he be either completely over the top in some scene or just very wooden his narration be a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character virginia madsen do the best she could with a limited role but she need to pick good script logan lerman be pretty bland a be danny huston overall the number be an awful thriller that offer more laugh than suspense or thrill rating,neutral

this be a typical steele novel production in that two people who have undergo some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds i wouldnt call this a spoiler because anyone who have read a steele novel know how they all end if you dont want to know much about the plot dont keep reading.gilberts character ophelia be a woman of french decent who have lose her husband and son in an accident gilbert need to stop do film where she be require to have an accent because she otherwise a good actress can not realistically pull off any kind of accent brad johnson also an excellent actor be matt who be recover from a rather nasty divorce he be gentle convincing and compelling in this role.the two meet on the beach through her daughter pip and initially ophelia accuses matt of be a child molester just because he talk art with the kid all of them become friend after this episode and then the couple fall in love.the chemistry between the two lead be not great even though the talent of these two people be not in my opinion a question they do the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that border on stereotypical two people meet tragedy big tragedy a secret be reveal another tragedy and then they get together i wish there be more to it than that but there it be in a nutshell.i want mindless entertainment and i get it with this in regard to the genre of romantic film this one fail to be memorable a secret affair with janine turner be far superior not a steele book a be some of steele earlier book turn into film,negative

deanna durbin nan grey and barbara read be three smart girl in this universal film from which introduces deanna durbin to film audience it also star ray milland mischa auer charles winninger john king binnie barnes and alice brady it a sweet story about three young woman now live in switzerland with their divorce mother who hear their father winninger be marry again not have see him in year and know their mother still love him they board a ship to america with the help of the housekeeper/nanny determine to stop the wedding realizing that the intend call precious barnes be nothing but a golddigger aid and abet by her mother brady they arrange for her to be introduce to a wealthy count this be arrange by their father accountant king the man he choose be a fulltime drunk auer but the girl mistake him for an actual wealthy count milland what a mess.this be a delightful film not cloy or overly sugary at all with some nice performance particularly by auer milland barnes and brady the young woman be pretty and all do good work the emphasis of course be on young durbin who be a natural actress and a beautifullytrained singer in fact her voice a a youngster be much more even than it would be a an adult she have no trouble with the high note a she do later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice she sing a delightful il bacio in a police station.one of the nice thing about the film be to see the father play by charles winninger not want his child around until he see them and get to know them barnes a the golddigger isnt all that young but the girl mother look way up there so the inference probably be the old man seek his youth with a young more glamorous woman in fact he find the youth he be seek in his daughters.universal give durbin the big star buildup here she have the final shot in the movie ray milland at this point be still pay his due and it will probably be a surprise even to film fan how young and attractive he is.very entertain and of course this lead to a sequel and big stardom for deanna,positive

okay last night august th i have the distinct displeasure of meet mr. van bebble at a showing of the film the manson family at the three penny in chicago a part of the chicago underground film festival heres what i have to say about it first of all the film be an obvious rip off of every kenneth anger roman polanski oliver stone and terry gilliam movie ive ever see second of all in a short q a session after the show mr. van bebble immediately state that he never make any contact with the actual manson family member or charlie himself call them liar and say he want nothing to do with them that the film be base on his van bebbles take on the trial have see it all from his living room on tv and in the news and im assume from the autobiography and the book helter skelter which be directly mimic through the narrative so i have second dibs on question i ask if he be try to present the outsider mtv sex drug and rock n roll version and not necessarily the true story this question obviously piss off the by now slosh director who start shout f you shut the f up this be the truth all those other movie be bullsh well anyway i didnt even think about how ridiculous this be until the next day when i read the tagline for the film youve hear the law side of the story ... now hear the story a it be tell by the manson family excuse me if this guy have never even speak to the family and considers them to be liar that he doesnt want to have anything to do with how in god name can he tell the story for them this be the most ridiculous statement i have ever hear the film be obviously cater to the sex drug and rock n roll audience that it have no trouble in attract to the small dimly lit theatre and be even more obviously spawn by the sex drug and rock n roll mind of a man who couldnt even watch his own film without get up every ten minute to go get more beer or to shout some sort of rocky horroresque call line to the actor on screen this film accomplish little more than warp the public image of actual event which help shape the state of america and much of the world today into some sort of slasher/comic book/porno/rape fantasy dream up by an obviously shallow individual.the film be definitely very impressive to look at the soundtrack be refresh a it contain actual sample of charlies work with the family off of his lie album the editing be nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music video all in all this film would have make a much good addition to the catalogue at mtv than to the underground film festival or for that matter the mind of any intellectual observer i felt like i be at a midnight rocky horror view the way the audience be dress and behave probably the best part of the experience the cast be very good with the exception of charlie who resemble some sort of stoned dungeon and dragon enthusiast more than the actual role he be portray the description the film give of him a full of energy throw ten thing at you and be very physical about it all the while do not match at all the slow lethargic and chubby representation that be actually presented.all in all the film basically explain itself a sadie or maybe it be linda declares at the end you can write a bunch of bullsh book or make a bunch of bullsh movie ... etc etc case in point even the disclaimer base on a true story be a dead giveaway signal that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and have make a difference in the world all you have to do be a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap or actually maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead.all i can say be this when the film end i get a free beer so im glad i go but not so glad i spent fifteen dollar on my ticket to be tell to shut the f up for ask the director a question peace,positive

this film could have be a decent remake and gosh know it try or ms. english try assemble talented actor together with a successful experienced writer/director should be a formula for a decent film but ms. english experience accord to her imdb bio be exclusively limit to television work and it be glaringly obvious throughout this film.i be surprise that none of the review i have read mention what i find most unlikeable about this film and what keep it from reach even a portion of it potential it look and felt like it be make for television to give some credit to ms. english many of the joke that simply do not work on a movie screen would have be terrific on tv and maybe a laugh track would have help so much of the camera usage and the lighting would have play out fine on tv but look awkward or odd on a big screen if the whole film have be chop up into a miniseries or a sitcom i think it could have work but this be cinema and sadly ms. englishs talent didnt translate i cringe at so many different point in my embarrassment for the actor the writer that i felt like i come out of the theater half shrivel meg ryan be her usual perky cute self except for the awful plastic surgery she have have on her face but where do she have a chance to use her talent she have make film where she doesnt recreate her stereotyped role and do them well ... but not here annette bening seem to simply go through the motion such a great talent and yet such a poor performance i enjoy the other woman character but they be more caricature than substance and it be sad to see what work in this film in the s doesnt translate to the s and no one help ms. english get the change update or subtlety right if only she a writer director and producer have reach out for some assistance i think it could have be good but it be not.its so frustrate to go to a movie that have good star and a good writer or director and come away feel it be a waste of everyones time money this new yorker cartoon i saw yesterday be appropriate a few movie exec be have a meeting the caption read let remake a classic with bad everything,positive

cmon guy some previous reviewer have nearly write a novel comment on this episode it just an old s tv show this episode of star trek be notable because of the most serious babe yeoman barrows ever use on star trek and the fact that it be film in a real outdoor location unlike the tng and voyager series which be totally confine to sound stages.this use of an outdoor location and babe give proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show.except a few notable exception i.e the city on the edge of forever assignment earth and tomorrow be yesterday the old series of star trek need to be seriously mothball and put out of it boring misery half a dozen good episode from be quite a poor batting average.this be typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produce back then actually contrary to popular belief where some people worship the ground he walk on he actually make a lot of rubbish he doesnt deserve to be speak of in the same eath a irwin allen for example.just look at the set of the idge of the enterprise from a modern point of view they use wobbly plywood for the floor cafeteria chair with plastic back and cheap cardboard above the instrument panel you can clearly see the fold in the paper every expense spar or what,neutral
i just watch this movie on it premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia i like not love mork mindy a a kid mostly for robin williams zany energetic performance this movie make me remember why be the original show great not really but robin certainly be which ings me to this movie.i be pleasantly surprised expect nothing more than a paint by number chronological retelling of the show which in a way it be but of course the real focus be on robin it be interest to see robin journey from struggle street jester to national t.v star and how such a drastic difference affect him and his long suffering wife and my hat be off to star chris diamantopoulos a he portray mr. williams with integrity sensitivity and heart not just a cute impression although it be even deadon on an unrelated note i notice that robin struggle be in some way similar to andy kaufman who be underappreciated by network t.v and hold back creatively but thats the taxi behind the scene biopic all in all this be a very enjoyable flick in which i felt i get to know a little more of the man behind the orkan the acting be solid by all never melodramatic like i suspect and the story move along well performance that be particularly good be by those who play garry marshall and john belushi the scene in which belushi heckle robin be a hoot not a great masterpiece by any mean i would have like to have see a tad more about pam dawber but definitely watchable especially for those robin williams and mork mindy fan out there nanoo nanoo,positive
i catch this film on azn on cable it sound like it would be a good film a japanese green card i cant say ive ever dislike an asian film quite the contrary some of the most incredible horror film of all time be japanese and korean and i be a huge fan of john woos hong kong film i an not adverse to a light hearted film like tampopo or chung king express two of my favourite so i thought i would like this well i would rather slit my wrist and drink my own blood than watch this laborious badly act film ever again.i think the director steven okazaki must have spike the water with quaalude because no one in this film have a personality and when any of the character do try to act a opposed to mumble a line or two their performance come across a forced and incredibly fake i honestly do not think that anyone have ever act before ... the only person who sound genuine be brenda aoki .. i find it amaze that this be promote a a comedy because i didnt laugh once even more surprising be that cbs morning news call this a refreshing eath of comedy it be neither refresh nor a eath of comedy and the end be very predictable the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things.avoid this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting i actually think that spike of bensonhurst be a well act film than this ... and i walk out half way through that film,positive
before i begin let me get something off my chest im a huge fan of john eyre first film project shadowchaser the film a bgrade cross of both the terminator die hard may not be the work of a cinematic genius but be a hugely entertaining action film that become a cult hit spawn two sequel a spin off .judge and jury begin with joseph meeker a convict killer who be send to death row follow his capture after the socalled bloody shootout which seem like a poor name for a killing spree â– meeker kill three people while try to rob a convenience store be lead to the electric chair there be an amusing scene where meeker talk to the priest about living for sex but meet his one true love who be kill during the shootout express his revenge for the person who kill her â– michael silvano a washedup football star who spend his day watch his son alex practice football with his high school team and end up harass his son coach but once execute meeker return a a revenant or a kelly perine call a hamburger without the fry whose sole aim be to get his revenge which basically mean make silvanos life a misery.let me point out the fact that judge and jury be not a true horror film it be a supernatural action film with meeker chase silvano use his ability to change form which amount to david keith dress up a everything from an elvis impersonator a french chef with an accent as bad a his moustache a drag queen a clown a standup comedian a shotgun which fire explosive round an invulnerability to death although that doesnt stop martin kove from shoot keith with a desert eagle to pay silvano back for kill meekers wife.director john eyre do not seem interested in characterisation instead focus solely on action scene which the film have plenty of but that be the film main flaw since there nothing to connect the action scenes together the acting be surprisingly good with keith deliver the best performance support ably by kove as well a paul koslo who play the washedup cop quite well kelly perine be annoy a the cabbie who try to help but make the situation worse,negative
ye lous film purple butterfly pit a secret organization purple butterfly against the japanese force in war torn shanghai ding hui zhang ziyi and her exlover hidehiko itami toru nakamura find themselves on opposite side of the conflict after a chance meeting.i agree with the reviewer from paris the film substitute a convoluted semihistorical conflict for a plot without give the audience a single reason to care about the character or their cause the sudden time shift doesnt help matter a it appear completely unwarranted and pointless normally i dont mind dark movie but the absence of light the bonejarringly shaky camera footage and the generally bad filmmaking technique really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in i also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film have a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography but i dont think that help the movie the backdrop to the film be one of the most potent event of the th century and i dont believe you can do it any justice by edit it a if it be a michael bay film the overly melodramatic moment dont add to it watchability.the actor be all suitably melancholy zhang ziyi once again show that she have an exceptionally limited act range a she spend the entire movie do what she seem to do best in all her film ooding and look generally annoy however at least she add some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engage in the bad lovemaking scene since michael biehn and linda hamilton in the terminator.all in all a very disappointing film especially see a how it come from the director of suzhou he,negative
after hear about george orwell prophetic masterpiece for all of my life im now but never have read the book i be totally confused a to what ive just seen.i be very familiar with the concept cover in the novel a im sure most be but only through hearsay and quote without this limited knowledge this film would have be a complete mystery and even with it im still no more educate about the story of than i be before i watch it.on the plus side ... the cinematography be amazing hurt burton deliver fine performance and the overall feel of the movie be wonderfully grim and desolate the prostitute scene be a fantastically dark piece of film making.now for the down side and there be plenty ... there be a war go on at least as far a the propaganda be concern but why with who nothing be explain there be a couple of name bandy about eurasia etc but they mean nothing without explanation.who be winston what do he do where do he come from where do he work why be he change news report why isnt he on the front line why doesnt he eat the food in the canteen what be that drink hes drink through the entire film why be he so weak ill why isnt he ainwashed like the rest of them whats the deal with his mother sister what happen to his father a little back story would have be nice no scrub that essential for those like myself that havent read the book without it this be just a confusing and hard to follow arthouse movie that constantly keep you guess at what be actually go on.the soundtrack be disjoint and badly edit and the constant chatter from the big brother screen swamp the dialogue in place make it even hard to work out whats go on i accept that this may have be an artistic choice but it very annoy all the same.also i know this have be mention before but why all the nudity it just seem totally gratuitous and felt like it have be throw in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage.i personally cant abide the way hollywood feel it have to explain story line word for word these day we be not all ainwashed simpleton but this be a few step too far the other way i can only imagine that it totally rely on the fact that youve read the book because if this film really be the literal translation that ive see many people say i would find it very hard to understand why be hail a the classic it is.theres no denying that it be light year ahead of it time and have pretty much predict every change in our society to date maybe this have be a sort of bible to the power that be but many scifi novelist have do the same without leave gap hole in the storyline.i guess i have to do what i should have do from the start and buy a copy of the book if im to make any sense out of this.all in all very disappointed in something ive wait for year to watch,negative

what seem at first just another introverted french flick offer no more than baleful sentiment become for me on second view a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation.spoiler of sort follows.poor cedric he apparently didnt know what hit him poor audience we be at first catch up in what seem a really beautiful and romantic story only to be lead back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch these two guy just didnt belong together from their first ambiguous encounter as much a mathieu and cedric be sexually attract to each other the absence of a deep emotional tie make it impossible for mathieu an intellectual be to find fulfillment in share life with someone whose sensibility be more attuned to carnival festivity and romp on the beach.on a purely technical note i love the camera action in this film subtitle be totally unnecessary even though my french be presque rien i could watch it again without the annoy english translation and enjoy it even more this be a polished very professionally make motion picture though many scene seem superfluous i rate it nine out of ten,positive
i dont think ive ever give something a rating but this one easily get the denomination i find it hard just to sit through one of his joke it not just that the joke be so bad but combine that with the fact that carson daily have zero charisma cant set up or finish a punchline and youve get a late night comedy recipe that will really turn your stomach.i have watch the show never in it entirety but many time still it just creep up on me after conan i usually watch a minute or two just to see if carson daily be still the bad talk show host ever.actually if you ever do see him interview a guest it just that an interview i feel so sorry every time he have a guest on and their confused smile try to mask their body language thats scream get me the hell away from this freak i do recommend watch the show not for a laugh but to ponder how he get on the air and what he still do there watch as much a you can i think you will find it complete awkwardness ... interesting,negative

from the film first shot keira knightley a elizabeth bennet wander read through a field at dawn thus invoke all the clichã©s cinema have develop to address the phenomenon of the strongminded rebellious female character in period drama i know i be in for something to make me want to kill myself.joe wright seem not only to have not read the book but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he be film be not in fact jane austens subtle nuanced comedy of manner conduct through sparkle delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawingrooms but a sort of ucertificate wuthering height thus we be treat to every scene between elizabeth and darcy take place outside for no apparent reason in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain not to mention that jane austen and in particular p p be not about passion sexual tension or love it about different strategy of negotiate the stultification of eighteenth century society which be completely ignore so that the bennet house be a rambunctious chaotic place where everybody shout at once run around leaf their underwear on chair and pig wander happily through the house the society ball become rowdy country dance one step away from a matrix reload style danceorgy and everybody say exactly what they think without the slight regard for propriety.the genius of jane austen lie in explore the void create by a society in which nobody say what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety and the tragic predicament of her character arise from misunderstanding and miscommunications enable by that speechless gap so both the illiance of jane austen and the very factor that allow her plot particularly in this film to function be completely erased subtlety in general be nowhere int his film sacrifice in favour of an overwrought drama which jar entirely with the material and the performances.it be so obviously try to be a serious film the humour which be pride prejudice both austen methodology and her appeal be almost entirely suppress in favour of all this pofaced melodrama and when it be allow in be handle so clumsily pride prejudice be a serious narrative which make serious point yes but those serious point and weighty theme be not just intertwine with the humour they be embed in it you cant lose jane austen technique leave only the bare bone of the story and expect the theme to remain not even when you replace her technique with your own heavyhanded mysticalnuminous fauxow cinematography.elizabeth bennett be suppose to be a woman an adult mature and sensible and clearsighted keira knightley play the first half of the film like an emptyheaded giggling schoolgirl and the second half like an emptyheaded schoolgirl who think she be a tragic heroine elizabeth wit her combative verbal exchange her quintessential characteristic of be able to see and laugh at everybodys folly include her own her strength and composure and her fantastic clearsightedness be completely lose and replace with ... what a lot of giggle and star into the distance rather than be able to keep her head when all about her be lose theirs she start to cry and scream at the slight provocation and not genuinely rag either no these be petulant hissy fit and where the great strength of austen elizabeth at least in austens eye be her ability to retain integrity and observance while remain within the boundary of society and sustain impeachable propriety knightleys elizabeth have no regard whatsoever for convention furthermore she seem to think that wander around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overall establish her beyond doubt a spirited and strongminded and therefore nothing in the character a write or the performance have to sustain it an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance in which quest for blandness and weakness she be ably match by matthew macfayden.donald sutherland a mr bennet seem weak ineffectual and permanently befuddle without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationship that make mr bennet so fascinating and tragic his special bond with lizzie a the only two sensible people in a world of fool be completely lose not least because both of them be fool in a world of fool and that completely deprive the end of the film of emotional impact mr bingley be no longer amiable and wellmeaning to the point of folly but be play a a complete retard for cheap laugh and the woman who be play jane be so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have try to do anything with the character at all the script veer wildly between verbatim chunk of jane austen deliver with remarkable clumsiness and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy.just get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache,positive

the story be very trustworthy and powerful the technical side of the movie be quite fine .. even the directing of it the main problem be with the casting that turn that movie into almost another local and regular clichã© with a great lack of impact and even great lack of impression beside the small role of the father rafael play impressively by asi dayan all other actor be unfortunately not in their best the role of the elder blind girl play by taly sharon be fresh but without any intensity a the lead role therefore the figure she act have become mild and low profile there be moment and episode that look more like a rehearsal then a real movie but after all it a good point to begin from and to make big improvement in the future,positive

this be one of a rarity of movie where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka to be completely honest we be a group of people who actually know the man mo ogrodnik and decide to drink ourselves stupid to this film.the cinematic aspect of wolfgang somethings photography seem to have leave out both closeup and east mo and wolfgangs collaborative effort reveal the passion of the two actress plastic peen hold passion there also beetle bang a violet would have put it this plastic peen go up your butt the rat porn and subsequent rat smashing be awesome alright so if you be still read let u explain who we be mo ogrodnik teach at nyu and we be a group of her student who finish a film class with her decide to get poop face and watch here directorial debut she also write uptown girl i cant tell you how much thats be hammer into our skull so this movie be quite the experience at the very bottom of this post will be a drinking game we create for this movie about minute into this game none of u could see straight the sheer amount of dido in the first thirty minute create enough reason to drink to pacify an elephant.there be something secretly pleasurable about see two underage girl hit on a kurt cobain lookalike with absolutely no context save for his mysterious scene at the convenience store where he be ohsonaturally read a local newspaper because thats what we all do the heartshaped glass be delightfully derivative of lolita and something about that provocative scene of the nude chinup boy suggest the director history of homosexual pornographic experiment we wish we be kidding.enough intellectual contemplation on to the drinking game this will ensure that the view experience be a positive one it very simple and very likely to send at least one member of your party to immediate care.the mo ogrodnik/ripe drink game every time you see anything relate to pornography take a drink every time you see auteur mo ogrodniks name appear take a drink sex plastic peen require two drink any time somebody point a gun at another character take a drink at this point you will probably need to refill/pee pee any remain soiety from your body any time there be blood include lady blood please take a sip the underused hulahoop girl require one drink per second gratuitous use of the magic black man require one drink if you cant figure out the throughline keep drinking beyotch whenever you be able to predict a line take a drink trust u it easy thats it internet keep drinking and try not to get riped.hawaiian smirnoff punch jr,positive
even though im quite young the beatles be my absolutely favourite band i never have the chance to hear their music a it be release but have love them since i can remember.its the sort of film that be worth try the once i can see why it wasnt release in the cinema but it be certainly a great film to put on the tv i be flick through my tv guide and happen to see this film it didnt much detail except something like john lennon and paul mccartney meet after the beatles have oken up jared harris star id never hear of him he play john or aiden quinn who play paul however they be certainly underestimated actor the film have a slow start but a it develop i could see how well quinn but especially harris play their character a a huge fan i sort of know what the real lennon and mccartney be like the script be illiant and harris get lennon accent personality and mannerism spot on quinn play mccartney quite well but sometimes go into his irish accent the makeup artist make them look excellent.this paragraph may be count a a spoiler a i mention before it get off to a slow start but soon develop and become quite an emotional film i find the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musician a for lennon rude line in the italian restaurant totally unnecessary the end be very poignant and ings a tear to my eye whenever i watch it.it be quite different from the other biographical film ive see where it about how the beatles get together and become famous and those never really do the character that well e.g backbeat.in conclusion i would say if youre a beatles or john lennon or paul mccartney fan give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise at only about minute long it worth wait for the film to develop.if anyone do know whether the meeting of really do happen please send it to the comment page for this film id be very interested,positive

the premise of this movie be decent enough but with sub par act it be just bland and dull.spoilers the film do not work because of the nature of the death it be accidental so although it be a murder it wasnt like the guy set out to do it also through some flashback there be a secret that be reveal that sort of make the event like justice to a degree there be no emotion in this film the first minute or so be just this woman call her sister and hear her message it be dull and boring.with some polishing and good act it could have be pretty good,negative
the life of the saint start off with an atmospheric vision of london a a bustle city of busy quaint street and sunshine i be hop it would maintain this atmosphere but it get bogged down in a story that go pretty much nowhere.othello work for big fat mr. karva his crimeboss stepdad at least i think that be what he be suppose to be because it never really defined but he do drop kitten into deep fat frier so trust me hes a prick do scrappy little errand while his skanky girlfriend give daddy handjobs one of his colleague be runner a black dude who be always dash from a to b. until the day he come across almost mute homeless child who grant him his wish of be able to stop run runner dump the lost boy in othello flat where he promptly start grant more wish keen to have some of his own desire fulfil karva have the boy kidnap but he isnt sure of what would really ing him happiness be it the innocence of be a child again or be it another handjob either way i dont want to see the little boy grant him the second.it just take age to get go and there be load of repetitive scene the end try to be shock but since there hardly any backstory on investment in any of these character it only serve a a release for the bored audience.writer tony grisoni a favourite of terry gilliam try to blend in some kind of religious allegory which end up be pretentious a all hell ironically if he give u something more accessible or at least have good explanation for the character suddenly act all weird then it would have be a more enjoyable film a it be we be introduce to a bunch of annoy loudmouth who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confront by the mysterious boy who origin be never reveal thats just plain irritate aside from sporadic moment of atmosphere and a moody score this film have little to recommend,positive

it be so gratifying to see one great piece of art convert into another without distortion or contrivance i have no guess a to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreate a a film worth see if you love bulgakovs book you would be understandably afraid of see some misguided interpretation do more for the sake of an artfilm project than for actually inging the story deeper meaning to the screen there be a couple example of this with the master and margarita a complex and farfetched a the story be the movie leave out nothing it be a if the filmmaker read bulgakovs work the same way an orchestral conductor read a scorewith not a note miss why cant we find such talent here in the u.s. so now my favorite book and movie have the same title,positive

the day have finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of azumis fate a an assassin fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deep into the world she rampage through so mercilessly during the first saga.thats as poetical a ill get when talk about azumi death or love because when i cringe over the heavy sentimentality of house of fly dagger and complain about the credibility of aya ueto portray a blooddriven assassin after watch azumi i start to appreciate the previously mention shortcoming more than ever before.not only do the determination of each assassin feel sluggish and uninspiring but also many important element be omit from the entire experience in azumi we saw the assassin use various stealth tactic which be their number one priority as well a logic to make easy work of their mark with swift execution and quick ability to escape but i wont hold that against this movie too much since the story be slightly tweak this time around and many more obstacle be plant in azumis way to prevent her from reach the warlord and display any sign of charisma by the way chiaki be foolishly shelve for the most part of the film and be basically play a tone down version of go go minus the cool weapon and sense of menace.this ings me to the final blow which be the action simply disguise in the title a the death side of the epic in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversary with flashy look and even flashy weapon to no one surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film fall short when each of them start die too fast and too easily in azumi the young assassin be mostly overpower the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battle and the final showdown between azumi and bijomaru in comparison to the fight in azumi be at least climaxed and worthwhile some interesting effect be introduce but they be unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter i be in no way knock down the conventional style of samurai film with their quick and realistic battle but character in both azumi film be so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rule could have be oken and the action should have be further enriched.the romance side of azumi be there to fill in time between the fight scene and unfortunately at the end it serve no purpose nor provide a much need resolution.as a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movie and animation i wont lie and ill admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first azumi film but ill step right up and say that after watch azumi the original be make to look like a flawless masterpiece for what it worth azumi death or love could have go straight to video with it invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassin do their best to restore the peace with an unwavering courage to die try,positive

im sure deep in the recess of jack black mind the character of nacho lie be absolutely hilarious but no it isnt you can tell ol jack have a whale of a time hammin it up play a smarmy slimy mexican friar with dream of become a wrestler but this movie be a total misfire in just about every single department.i just sit there through most of the movie thinking be this suppose to be funny and this be the guy from tenacious d right the truth be this film have nothing to offer at all it a lousy script with crappy character and really naff acting and direction youll watch endless moment where you think something funny be surely about to happen but it just doesnt i be bore stupid about minute in but though it would surely pick up it didnt minute later id barely manage to stave off an aneurism it be that painful.its like remember year ago when youd see anything with your fave actor in it even some of their really early pap from before they be famous and youd be really embarrassed that say actor be actually in such a load of plop yeah it like that.ive enjoy some of jack black earlier movie like shallow hall and im really look forward to see pick of destiny but come on man if you do this to u again jack im gon na have to come round there and hammer your kneecap or something at the least give you a serious talk to.i know it a clichã© but this be one of the bad movie ive ever see and for so many reason ....,positive
i havent read the anne rice novel that this movie be base on but who know maybe read the book be cheap than rent queen of the damned and be probably well for your health it isnt that this movie be necessarily bad for your health but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercise the active part of your ain more so than this movie you can count the number of page by anne rice that ive read on one hand but after see this movie and interview with a vampire i get the feeling that she write really good novel the plot for both movie hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history.still stuart townsends voiceover narration get a heck of a lot more annoy than brad pitts vampire narrative ever do and you can tell that queen of the damned limited production resource barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline while interview decide to go with lace and elegance queen relies on low budget special effect that try really hard to be take seriously one can see that the original novel have potential a a movie and that the production team focus it attention in the wrong place the costume and rock roll stage could have be replace with more blood and an eerier soundtrack.however ill give credit where credit be due the soundtrack be excellent korn and disturbed have me down with the sickness bob my noggin like butthead.the film open with a very cool gothrock zoom splice montage but after the first ten minute or so the directing degenerate quickly it a if the movie be so long that the director realize that there wasnt enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice what result be some mediocre vampire scene and plenty of cheesy special effect unfortunately queen of the damn fails to do the genre justice just a it john carpenter counterpart fail to impress where be the yellow contact wheres the pale blue makeup scene after scene i shake my head reminisce about the day of salems lot and fright night when low budget be do right.there be redeem quality though that save this movie from be garbage prop to aaliyah and may her soul forever rest in peace she might have become a renowned actress have her life not be take from u so prematurely for she do give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dance do i mention that the soundtrack be good let see what else can i say it wasnt too long the anne rice novel could have easily be a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola get his hand on it there be a few twist and turn here and there in the plot but all in all it be a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of secondrate vampire movie out there the director of this movie go on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tell you anything.jyjimboduckdotcom,positive
while i count myself a a fan of the babylon television series the original movie that introduce the series be a weak start although many of the element that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series be there the pace of the gathering be slow the makeup somewhat inadequate and the plot confuse bad the characterization in the premiere episode be poor although the rating chart show that many fan be willing to overlook these problem i remember the gathering almost turn me off off what soon grow into a spectacular series,negative

if you wish to see shakespeare masterpiece in it entirety i suggest you find this bbc version indeed it be overlong at four and a half hour but jacobys performance a hamlet and patrick stewart a claudius be well worth the effort.it never cease to amaze me how clear hamlet be when you see it in it length and order a set down by the bard every film version of hamlet have tinker with it structure olivier concentrate on hamlet indecision gibson on his passion jacoby be able to pull all of these aspect of hamlet character together with the aid of shakespeare full script.why do hamlet not kill claudius immediately hamlet say i be very proud revengeful ambitious ... hamlet be extremely upset not only for his father death and suspected murder or his mother marriage to his uncle but also and mostly because claudius have usurp the throne belonging to hamlet he be furious at his mother for marry claudius marriage between royal kin be not unknown do for political reason but that her marriage solidify claudius claim to the throne before he could return from wittenburg to claim it for himself he be therefore impotent to do anything about it and this be true even after he hear his father ghost cry vengeance he can not simply kill the king or he will lose the throne in do so he must out the king secret and here be the tragedy at the moment hamlet be successful in display claudius guilt in public he have opportunity to kill him and do not why he want it all he want revenge the throne and the damnation of claudius soul in hell hamlet overreach himself in classic tragic form his own hubris be his undo he kill polonius think it be claudius and the rest of the play spiral down to the final death of rosencrantz guildenstern ophelia laertes gertrude claudius and hamlet himself,negative

if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it this film be actually quite entertain it got action adventure and romance and one of the premiere cast matchup of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead role a evident on this board the picture doesnt pas muster with purist who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story tell to get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story a if it be a work of fiction i know i know thats hard to do when you consider custer last stand at the little big horn and it prominence in the history of post civil war america so i guess theres an unresolved quandary with the picture no matter how you look at it.theres a lot to take in here though for the picture two hour plus run time custer arrival at west point be probably the first head scratcher rid up a he do in full military regalia the practical joke by sharp arthur kennedy put him up in the major headquarters probably should have get them both in trouble.ironically a lot of scene in this military film play for comedy a in custer first meeting with libby bacon and subsequent encounter that include tea reader callie hattie mcdaniel i hadnt notice it before in other film but mcdaniel remind me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forty mantan moreland so much so that in one scene it look like it might have be moreland ham it up in a dress with that in mind the owl scene be a hoot too.as for flynn it interesting to note that a year earlier he portray j.e.b stuart opposite ronald reagans depiction of general custer in santa fe trail both vie for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland in that film reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers while in flynns portrayal here it more than evident but it doesnt come close to that of richard mulligan take on the military hero in s little big man let just say that one be a bit over the top.the good take away the picture have for me be the manner in which custer persevere to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture that and his loyalty to the men he lead in battle along with the discipline he develop over the course of the story most poignant be that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before rid into the little big horn in which he declare that hell or glory be entirely dependent on one point of view earlier a similar remark might have give u the best insight of all into custer character when he state you take glory with you when it your time to go,positive
the film quickly get to a major chase scene with ever increase destruction the first really bad thing be the guy hijack steven seagal would have be beat to pulp by seagals drive but that probably would have end the whole premise for the movie.it seem like they decide to make all kind of change in the movie plot so just plan to enjoy the action and do not expect a coherent plot turn any sense of logic you may have it will reduce your chance of get a headache.i do give me some hope that steven seagal be try to move back towards the type of character he portray in his more popular movie,positive

any film about wwii make during wwii by a british production company have no latterday peer in my opinion respectfully the confluence of so many thing near and dear to my heart be in at dawn we dive a a descendant of admiral horatio nelson and student of all aspect of world war two and particularly naval warfare i favor depiction of sub and action in the north atlantic and especially those which include the german side of thing for those unacquainted with target priority an attack on an enemy warship be the great event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here the pacing be deliberate and typical of the work come out of the ealing rank and britishgaumont studio back in the day frankly i prefer it quieter more cereal approach for it humanity and realism that engage far good than any overproduced hollywood movie ever could this remind me of powell and pressburgers the th parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive eric portman a favorite of mine john mill receive second billing and a small font in the title so this be clearly mean to be mr. portmans film but the whole cast shine a for the title sequence be i the only one who be utterly charm by gainsborough production lovely precgi gainsborough girl,positive

i have just give a for thief highway i mention this for two reason one to prove im not a git who only give bad review but because the theme of the film have the same thread namely the fall in love with a woman of the night.we all know pretty woman be a chick flick but you cant avoid them all theyll eventually get you pretty woman for me do two thing two terrible horrible ghastly thing firstly it portray prostitution a a career more akin to that of a dancer you know with absolutely great friend leg warmer lot of giggle borrow each others make up you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this be a street walker prostitute be talk about here have a great life shes healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament my feeling be this happy hooker type protagonist be a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character which for me beg the question if you make a movie about a type of person but be too chicken scar to adorn that player with the characteristic familiar to that role then why do it if i make a film about a chef but dont want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place by bail out and turn the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story miss the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social question that it could have what a cop out really really lame secondly pretty woman insult romance itself edward lewis play by richard gere have no clue how to seduce or romance this lady that be without his plastic friend yep dont leave home without it especially if you be a moron in a suit who have no imagination out of of his romantic moment involve splash cash in one way or another even when he first meet her it the lotus esprit turbo that do all the work necklace here diamonds there limos over there money money money wheres the charm wheres the charisma dont mention that attempt at the piano please.girls who like this film will also be girl who like shop more than most guy who like this film will not even have realize that old eddy have less charm than a calculator a they probably dont either so it wont have register more importantly anyone who like this film will hate thief highway a wonderful story of which part be base on the same subject.ill finish on a song pretty woman hangin round the street pretty woman the kind i like to treat pretty woman i dont believe you youre not the truth no one could spend as much a you mercypretty woman wont you pardon me pretty woman i couldnt help but see pretty woman and you look lovely a can be do you lack imagination just like mepretty woman shop a while pretty woman talk a while pretty woman sell your smile to me pretty woman yeah yeah yeah pretty woman look my way pretty woman say youll stay with me .. and ill pay you .. ill treat you right,positive

i strongly dislike this show i mean like basically everyone at that school be perfect and rich and i doubt a boarding school would look as cool a that and why do they suddenly allow girl into the school isnt that just a little weird anyways jamie lynn spear can not act she always have the same facial expression which really annoy me she be basically emotionless and all the guy seem to like her.and shouldnt chase tell her he like her it not that hard really none of this show be real life and she isnt a girl like me because majority of the regular girl do not go to board school do not have designer clothes and do not live by the beach.fake fake fake,positive

i saw this at the london film festival last night apparently the short version james mcnallys summary of the content of the film be very good nossiter very deftly blend his investigation of the wine business into wider concern about globalisation homogenisation the effect of the mass medium the power of capital and the need for diversity.the film be shoot on handheld dv which some might find offputting but which do enable nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasion which probably would not have be possible use more conventional equipment.despite the sprawl feel of the film the editing be very sharp not only give u a parade of the world dog but also undercut a number of interviewee comment with somewhat contradictory visual image and give others sufficient rope to hang themselves to a degree this evoke michael moore recent work although nossiter operates in a more subtle way but probably the root of the film go back to marcel ophuls the sorrow and the pity both in the way the film be construct and in the emergence of salt of the earth french peasant a the star de montille pere et fils be present at the lff screening and answered question afterwards we do indeed all need a little disorder avo hubert overall an excellent film with implication that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves a people and organise our world,negative
i cant believe this movie manage to get such a relatively high rating of it be barely watchable and unbelievably bore certainly one of the bad film i have see in a long long time.in a nobudget way it remind me of star war episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you be watch a total creative train wreck.this film should be avoid at all cost it one of those festival film that only please the pseudointellectuals because they be so badly make those people think it make it different therefore good.bad filmmaking be not different it just bad filmmaking,negative
this movie really wake me up like it wake up the main male character of this avely different movie from his life slumber.this guy john ben chaplin lead his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town until the stunningly gorgeous wild girltodiefor nadia nicole kidman order by email from russia enters his life to become his beloved wife by john plan however a glitch turn up nadia do not speak a word of john language although calm and emotionless on the outside john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of use the full refund policy of the matching service he buy her a dictionary to start the communication process.what happen henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decentlypaid safefeeling clerk into a decisionmaking decently think action figure give the viewer a subliminal message you would have probably act likewise.kidman cassel kassovitz make a great team act russian and they be almost indistinguishable from the real thing almost only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogue however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work do to get the word sound right nicole kidman prove her talent once again by play a character quite different from the previous role at least from the cultural background.the pace of the film be fast and captivate and you certainly be not ready to quit watch when the end title appear you rather feel that youre in the middle of the plot and be leave with a desire to see the sequel as soon a it come out.my advice be to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy to sum it up it have an unusual plot great acting and idea below the surface like the idea of the rude awaken from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a societys machine the life which member of the fight club be so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings welcome to the machine i bet that in the end john be rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not have meet her at all.thank you writer for the great story and everyone else for this great movie please make a sequel and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever because the authenticity of the place be irrelevant to the percent of the potential viewer i be sure of it,positive

we usually think of the british a the expert at render great adventure from the imperial age with the like of the four feather and zulu simply because the imperial age be for the most part british here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age.americas projection of power under teddy roosevelt be the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who despite her gentility be smite by the rough manly nobility of her captor who in turn be disarm by her beauty and scorn politically correct prig eager to see some slight of native people or culture can rest assure that the way arab and muslim be depict here be far more flattering than the way their modern counterpart depict themselves on the current world stage what make this story different be the terrific production value faultless photography composition and edit the terrific cast the underappreciated brian keith play a bully teddy and vivid history.though the wind and the lion be tell largely through the eye of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the character whether it be sean connerys noble igand candace bergens feisty heroine john huston wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt big stick there be a transcendent scene at the end when the little boy be symbolically sweep away by the dash moor on his white steed this be high adventure at it best,positive
i have be look forward to see dreamgirls for quite a while ... what with all it raving review nomination and medium attention and i must say the first quarter of the movie be good it really portray the black music scene back then however a the movie wore on me and my whole family be bore out of our wit the singing just keep come one after the other i mean seriously just one more music number and it would have oke even with rent.furthermore i notice hardly any character development in any of the character i just didnt care what happen to them even when eddie murphys character die of a drug overdose i know i should have be sad but i just couldnt feel any emotion for that character the character be give a flimsy background about sing in their childhood and whatnot but there personality be not reveal enough to draw me in.finally the conflict be simply not significant enough to make the viewer care which go along with the lack of character development this movie remind me of a copycat movie base on ray chicago and rent ray and chicago be wonderful movie in my opinion overall i think this movie would best suit someone who doesnt really care about an overall story yet would enjoy two hour of entertain and fun singing performance,positive

nice character development in a pretty cool milieu be a male im probably not qualify to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establish the restrictive victorian environment from the start it isnt as bleak a it really be and the treatment of woman be probably even harsher what make this go be a wonderful chemistry among the principal character each have their own thing that they contend with once they come out of the rain and eak out of the spider web they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion what i enjoy about this movie be that it didnt go for cheap comedy when it could have it didnt try to pound a lesson into u the people who seem utterly without merit be really nicely developed human being who get to see the light i do have a little trouble with the alfred molina character have such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it need to happen good act all around with something positive take place in the life of some pretty good people,positive

this be yet another western about a greedy cattle baron look to push out small rancher and farmer it certainly all be do before and since but the violent men be something special.what make it special be barbara stanwyck play the role of vixen a she often do in her late film shes marry to the cripple edward g. robinson whos the cattle baron here but robinson be cripple and there be some hint that his injury may have leave him impotent no matter to barbara whose need be be meet by her otherinlaw brian keith that doesnt sit well with either dianne foster who be robinson and stanwycks daughter nor with lita milan who be keiths mexican girl friend.the infidelity subplot almost take over the film but glenn ford a the stalwart small rancher who be a civil war veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here hes every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of push once too often i almost expect those famous word from wild bill elliott to come out of ford mouth im a peaceable man would have be very applicable in the vioilent men.the fifty be the age of the adult western theme be enter into horse opera that hadnt be explore before the following year glenn ford would do another western jubal one of his best which also explore infidelity a a plot component.theres enough traditional western stuff in the violent men and plenty for those who be addict to soap operas as well,negative

well heres another terrific example of awkward s filmmaking the rudimentary premise of whats the matter with helen be quite shocking and disturb but it present in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion in the hand of any other movie crew this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale but with director curtis harrington whoever slew auntie roo and scriptwriter henry farrell hushâ…hushâ…sweet charlotte in charge it become a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of theme and genres the basic plot of the film be definitely horrific but theres a lot more to experience like love story a swing s atmosphere and a whole lot of sing and tapdance the setting be unquestionably what make this movie so unique be literally catapult back to the s with a sublime depiction of that eras music religion theatrical business and wardrobe follow the long and exhaust trial that sentence their son to lifeimprisonment for murder adelle debbie reynolds and helen shelley winter flee to california and attempt to start a new life run a dance school for young talented girl particularly adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment a she fall in love with a local millionaire but poor old helen continue to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia she only listen to the ramblings of a radioevangelist fear that she will be punish for the crime her son commit and slowly develops violent tendency the script although not entirely without flaw be well write and the film be adequately paced there never a dull moment in whats the matter with helen although the sing tapdancing and tango sequence be quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot but the atmosphere be continuously ominous and the film definitely benefice from the terrific act performance of shelley winter shes downright scary a the unpredictable and introvert lady who about to snap any second and especially during the last ten minute or so she look more petrifying than all the freddy kruegers jason voorhees and michael myers combine there be several terrific supportive character who be sadly a little underdeveloped and rob from their potential like michã©al macliammã³ir a the cocky elocution teacher agnes moorehead a the creepy priestess and timothy carey a the obtrusive visitor to the lady house there be a couple of surprisingly gruesome scene and moment of genuine shock to enjoy for the grand guignol fanatic among u but particularly the set piece and costume design even nominate for an oscar be eathtaking,positive
resnais wow the genius who ought u hiroshima mon amour take on the challenge of make a s french musical in viant colour the opening voiceover with old embellished intertitles be a nice touch then the camera aperture open like the old hand crankers on a black white placard the camera back off or rather up suddenly show u the surprisingly illiant colour of an elegant table set for a tea party this be all in the first seconds.then the music start a rather banal and forgettable diddy feature an unconvincing chorus of girl blabber some nonsense which have no relevance to the film and yes i speak french so i cant blame it on the subtitle those character whiz out the door and be replace by more people who eak into an even more forgettable song then they leave and finally audrey tautou appear and we hear our first appreciable dialogue minute into the film.im not sure what resnais intend by start off with such a yawn waste of time musical cacophony but the effect on the viewer be to make you want to hurl skittle at the screen and storm out i endured.it didnt get much good ill tell you why there be absolutely no familiarity with any of the character we dont even see their face half the time a resnais seem too intent on show off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera people flit on off stage like moth around a lamp and we the audience be unable to focus on any particular person or plot it a if you be to take every episode of the brady bunch and cram it into a hour movie with bad songs.the only thing that keep me watch as long a i do hour be that i be look at the camera techniques light and scenery which be all i admit excellent but be that enough to hold your attention for hour not me maybe tomorrow ill try watch the end aw who be i kidding i have more important thing to do im sure you do too skip this,positive

this movie take the plot behind the scifi flick doppelganger an astronaut from our earth crash on a counterearth on the opposite side of the sun and the cold war totalitarian vibe on that world and try to turn it into a pilot for a tv series however the whole thing sank without a trace and tv be probably well off for it.everyone here be perfectly adequate in a make for tv way cameron mitchell turn in his usual solid performance so do glenn corbett who seem to be a kind of poor man john saxon who play the rugged individualist whose very existence pose a threat to the foundation of the world order on counter earth.but the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set design and cinematography keep this scifi adventure firmly tether on the launch pad.ill give one example in the original template for this pilot doppleganger the astronaut lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence it be obvious that their ship be never go to fly again then the two astronaut stagger helplessly from the smoking remain of their vehicle in the middle of howl rain and wind only to be smack down and overcome by faceless men yell through loudspeakers.in strand in space the astronaut be sit in their seat when buzzer sound thing start shake and the camera blur into a blackout and a a friend point out it be pretty obvious that the actor be simply shake themselves on their seat the director wasnt even shake the camera or the set ive see episode of the twilight zone and the outer limit that take more effort to establish mood and set than this madefortv mediocrity.and that in essence be whats wrong with strand in space no budget no time no imagination ... just make the token gesture and hop the scifi fan boys imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest sorry guy it didnt work im sure that everyone here just finish their work on this one and walk away and never think of it again except a a listing on their c.v. and thats what you the viewer will do youll remember if press that you once watch a tv movie call strand in space but it make no lasting impression on you and you cant recall too much about it,negative

there be a difference between a film and a movie a film regardless of quality be ready for public consumption a movie be what a group of friend get together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder in my time a a viewer i have see may example of both.on september i attend a screening of writer/director jon satejowskis donnyook now have read the script and have see two different cut a rough cut and the finished product of this piece i can safely say it be a movie and a student movie at that it be for lack of a good word competent which be to say the director know how to push record on a camera and capture move image the visuals be for the most part static and unimpressive and dialog scene be reduce to mostly long shot with little to no close up shot to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the character i understand that this be a modestly budget film but some visual flair would have be appreciate and it would have go a long way toward keep the audience interested.granted there have be independent picture that have show that limited camera work can be over come with well a well write engross story and some sharp dialog steven soderberghs sex lie and videotape come immediately to mind this movie however have neither the main story be weak and unfocused if the main plot be davie try to mend his relationship with his father then i feel this movie miss the point what i get out of it be that davy main aspiration be to change the face of rock n roll however we see very little activity on his part to show this while there be one dream sequence at the beginning and an impromptu performance of his at the end all we seem to get be scene of davie listen to music or casually strum a guitar we be simply told that davie have play a lot of gig but we never see him in full rock out mode next time show dont tell the audience anyone who have take a creative writing class know this also davie doesnt look like someone that would have be big in the glam rock era of the s he look like hed be more comfortable in the early day of rock n roll posing a james deans less talented other in the meantime the rest of the movie event seem to happen at random to rather clichã© character and story thread that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story be ought up and abandon with alarm frequency i.e the subplot involve terry father if i want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction i will consider watch napolean dynamite again a film i could barely make it through the first time.as for the above mention dialog scene i guess i should mention that they be few and extremely far between be it too much to ask for character who do speak i dont think it be when the character do speak it be in short choppy sentence collection of oh so insightful question anger grunt or wildly overthetop outburst these character simply do not behave like normal rational people work with material like this it be easy to understand why there be only one good performance in the film al hudson and thats just because he do a poor imitation of sam elliott for his time on screen a good director or at least one who be ready for the challenge of a feature director would have be able to spot these problem and get the writer and camera people to correct them however with satejowski be so close to the material he simply doesnt see them or if he do he be unwilling to take the necessary step to fix them because itll hurt his creative vision be unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner be the mark of a selfindulgent misguided fool just ask rob schneider in the end we be leave with a poor highschoolset knockoff of zach braffs amaze garden state combine with the equally amazing velvet goldmine two film far more worthy of your time.now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review allow me to offer this the best i can do be compliment mr. satejowski for have the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see however the hope that this movie will be pick up and distribute be simply deluded vision of grandeur this be a student movie nothing more nothing le if the movie hold any promise and let face it at this point it isnt go to come from the act writing or direct it be this if if the people associate with this film be willing then please learn from this movie file it away and use the lesson learn on your next attempt dont attack your critic or have friend or family do it for you if you be able to do this maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution worthy of be call a film.i be your audience and i be willing to watch,positive

warn review contains mild spoilersa couple of year back i manage to see the first five film in this franchise and be plan to do an overview of the whole elm st. series however just two year on and i find i cant remember enough about them in order to do it â– i guess they couldnt have make much of an impression from what i do recall some of the sequel â– dream warrior in particular â– werent as bad a be often make out though even the original be no classic generally the predictability of the premise if people fall asleep they get murder in their dream doesnt lend itself to narrative tension but while i can not recall much of the first five film i do know they never plumb the depth of freddys dead.an indication of how sick of freddy the public be at this point can be judge by the fact that the film be promote solely on the character demise the fact that the movie conclusion be not even hide but in fact the entire purpose for the film be go to illustrate how vacant soulless and cynical this venture was.taking the morally questionable idea of have a child molester a the charismatic villain robert englunds innowayscary interpretation boom with laughter i always think freddys mockery of the teenage victim be less aim at the character than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe it like englunds cry out we know this be garbage â– but youre pay to see it so whos the one laughing and im sure victim of child abuse would be dishearten to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight be freddys appearance in the film always so rudimentary all he get to do here be a few haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr â– har â– har â– hars and thats it if this be the only elm st. film youd ever see you wouldnt get to know the character at all even a the character predeath in a flashback englund play him a a boohiss pantomime villain with a slop of transatlantic ie overstate misplaced and not at all funny irony.acting be almost universally poor just look at how many time breckin meyer overacts with his hand gesture and body language only kananga himself yaphet kotto keep his dignity and when roseanne tom arnold and alice cooper show up you can almost visibly see the film sink far into the mire the script too be absolutely lousy almost wholly without merit carlos ricky dean logan open a road map upon which the noel cowardlike freddy have wittily write youre f ked when prompt for the map carlos respond well the map say be f ked who write the screenplay oscar wilde or how about the scene where carlos be torture by freddy his hearing enhance to painful level so freddy torment him by threaten to drop a pin â– a potentially fatal sound give that all sound be magnify oddly the fact that carlos shout at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seem to have no effect nice hear from you carlos quip freddy hop some good line will come along it also worth note that dream sleep doesnt occur instaneously so be knock unconscious wouldnt allow instant access into freddys world though a part of the narrative contain a human computer game and a d finale plot logic isnt that high on the list of requirements.the teenager head the cast this time be really the most obnoxious dislikeable group in the whole series tracy lezlie deane be the only one who get to greet freddy with shut the f k up man and a kick in the scallop and be incongruous pop music always part of the ingredient freddys dead no laugh no scar no interest no fun,negative
some comment here on imdb have liken dog bite dog to the classic cat iii film of the s but although it be undoubtedly utal violent and very downbeat this film from pousoi cheang isnt really sleazy lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison however it still pack a punch that make it worth a watch particularly if gritty hardedged action be your thing.edison chen play pang a cambodian hitman who travel to hong kong to assassinate the wife of a judge sam lee be wai the ruthless cop who be determine to track him down whatever the cost with wai closing in on his target pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeâ—until he meet yue a pretty illegal immigrant who need his help to escape her life of abuse.a relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography amaze sound design a haunting score and solid performance from chen and lee as well a newcomer pei pei a pang love interest dog bite dog be one for fan of hardhitting asian hyperviolence think along the line of chanwook park vengeance trilogy stabbings shooting merciless beating all happen regularly in this film and be catch unflinchingly by director cheang.of course this be the kind of tale that be destine to have an unhappy end for all involve and sure enough pretty much everyone in this film die rather nasty death unfortunately there be a fine line between tragedy and unintentional comedy and in it final moment dog bite dog cross it in a laughably overdramatic final scene pang and wai be lock in battle a a pregnant yue look on eventually after all three have suffer severe stab wound during the fracas a wounded pang perform a diy ceasarean on a now dead yue deliver their baby moment before he himself dies.whilst this film might not be a classic slice of hong kong excess with it deliriously ott action and stylish visuals it still worth seek out,negative

i have decide to not believe what famous movie critic say even though this movie do not get the best comment this movie make my day it get me think what a false world this is.what do you do when your most loved one deceive you it say that no matter how often you fee milk to a snake it can never be loyal and will bite when give a chance same way some people be such that they be never grateful this movie be about how selfish people can be and how everyone be ultimately just think about oneself and work for oneself a other die inadvertently at the hand of a gangster the survive other decides to take revenge through this process we learn about the futility of this world nothing be real and no one be loyal to anyone.amitabh give the performance of his life the new actor aryan give a good performance the actress who play the wife of amitabh steal the show her role be small but she portray her role so diligently that one be move by her performance chawla have really great face expression but her role be very limited and be not give a chance to fully express herself.a great movie by raj kumar santoshi his movie always give some message to the audience his movie be like novel of nanak singh a punjabi novelist who novel always have a purpose and target a social evil because they have a real message for the audience they be entertain as well a lessongiving,positive

the box be why i originally pick up this movie and the back be why i rent it but i soon learn that i have be dupe i have think this movie would be something like a road trip/eurotrip/american pie deal but i be wrong this movie be one of the dumb ive see in a long time the unrated version tease you in to watch but will completely disappoint you the act be terrible and sound effect just gaudy it appear very low budget with the entire setting take place in the same building go out and get eurotrip or road trip instead i cant believe national lampoon put it name on this dont buy it dont rent it dont waste hour of your life on this,negative
there have be many documentary that i have see in which it appear that the law be on the wrong side of the fence the thin blue line and paradise lose come to mind first and foremost but this be the first film that have me seethe with anger after i saw it it seem blatantly clear to me from the evidence present in this film that what happen at waco be at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the fbi and afi and at the very bad an act of murder like most people when the siege at waco be occur i assume that david koresh be a completely evil madman who be lead a violent cult after see this i think that koresh be more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently catch the attention of the u.s. government through his eccentric action sure there be lot of weapon at the branch davidian compound but none of it be illegal it be absolutely hearteaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound all of them seem to be very nice and harmless and it be anger to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government force on the waco site the clueless testimony of janet reno and the partisan defense of the attack on waco a defense lead by a few of the committee democrats stand out most in my mind be ny representative and current u.s. senator from ny charles schumer i vote for the man when i live in ny state im a democrat pretty leftleaning too after see his action on this committee i wish i could go back in time and vote for damato instead for anyone remotely interested in the government this be a very crucial film a must see i even think this should be show in class it that important,negative
i saw this movie last night and think it be decent it have it moment i guess you would say some of the scene with the special ops force be cool and some of the location shot be very authentic i wont be put this movie in my dvd collection but it be fair enough to recommend for rent i guess nothing set the movie at another level compare to others of the same genre the action be good the acting be decent the woman be extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion and the story be pretty interest out of ten,positive
yes i call this a perfect movie not one bore second a fantastic cast of mostly little known actress and actor a great array of character who be all well define and who all have understandable motif i could sympathize with perfect light crisp black and white photography a fitting soundtrack an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that be engage and work it one of those prime quality picture on which all the pride of hollywood should rest the mark everyone should endeavor to reach.barbara stanwyck be simply stun there be nothing this actress couldnt do and she always go easy on the melodramatic side no hysterical outburst with this lady i always think she be a good actress than screen goddess like bette davis or joan crawford and this movie confirm my opinion always as tough a nail and at the same time convey true sentiment it be fair to add that she also get many good part during her long career and this one be by far the least interesting.the title fit this movie very well it be about desire human desire i think everyone can understand actually no one seem to be scheme in this movie all character act on impulse everybody want to be happy without hurt anybody else the sad fact that this more often than not lead to complication make for the dramatic content into which i will not go here.i like what this movie have to say about youth about mature and about the necessity to compromise the movie i associate most with this one be alfred hitchcock shadow of a doubt it create a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricature small town america the story have a certain similarity with fritz langs considerably harsher movie clash by night make one year earlier where stanywck star in a similar part i can also recommend it,positive

i saw the movie hoot and then i immediately decide to comment it the truth be that nature need protection from u because we be the dominant specie of this planet some people think that if they have money they can do whatever they want to which probably be like but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful this movie be not just about kid this movie be show u that the kid be usually the one that care more about it then the adult do when i be twelve i saw some waterlilies and i knew they be protect by law and didnt even dare to touch them not fear of the law but fear that i might harm them actually i be currently what so ever the acting be great the main character be well interpreted and we all have to learn from them i hope you all think about what you saw in that movie and enjoy,positive

when i first saw this film around month ago i consider it interest but little more but it stick with me that interest grow and grow and i wonder whether my initial boredom and response have more to do with the actual vhs quality rather than the film itself i purchase the criterion dvd box set and it turn out that i be right the second time alexander nevsky be a great film it be rouse and im sure it succeed in it main aim propaganda against the germans.that be the most common criticism against this film and against eisenstein that it be merely propagandist and nothing else it untrue he be an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever live by now the world be far enough beyond joseph stalin to be able to watch eisenstein film a art,positive

despite a totally misleading advertising campaign this flick turn out to be an irritatingly clichã©d subpar haunt house flick with a totally implausible end clue for all consider see this turkey sam raimi didnt direct it although commercial for the movie play up his involvement in truth he be one of four producer it too bad that someone as talented a raimi have allow his name to be use in conjunction with such a poor movie i dont think he would ever have direct something like this that task be leave to the pang brothers.the screenplay for this film seem to have be cobble together from numerous other horror film so youll find absolutely zero original content in the messenger what we get be a scene here and there that be pluck straight out of pulse a couple that could have come from the bird one or two from the others etc nearly every scene almost every line of dialogue be one that have be lift from any number of other movie the whole thing make for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the surprise end long before it comes.right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign center on the idea that only child can see ghost have nothing to do with this movie in fact everyone can see the ghost the teenage daughter and mother character certainly see them even quite early in the movie im sure that whomever be in charge of marketing come up with this campaign because the film need a unique angle to have any box office appeal which otherwise be entirely absent now you know so dont be fool perhaps what this movie lack most of all be anything resemble chemistry between the actor it simply isnt there all of the interaction come across a awkwardly stilted couple with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot hole just what be a guy who murder his whole family do still lurk around the small town where the murder happen anyhow didnt anyone think to maybe arrest him it all add up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manage to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shot loud noise visual flash and anything short of a sheeted figure jump out of a closet and yell boo all we get for our buck this time around be yet another poorlymade film about spirit attempt to warn people away from a house if there any message that the messenger deliver it dont waste your time on this movie,negative
this movie suck ass something about a heatwave in some european country complete trash there nothing go for this movie whatsoever maybe second of sex but thats it there be a very annoying chick who hitch ride with people and really piss me off this movie be complete rash and you shouldnt subject yourself to watch it i regret it it very boring i would rate it zero but i cant no body in their right mind should see this im sure youll regret it completely i do how could they think up something this bad even mystery men be well mystery men that suck that movie wasnt worth be make complete waste of time the character in this be very hard to understand and i good very very very bored,negative
i be look forward to the guardian but when i walk into the theater i wasnt really in the mood for it at that particular time it kind of like the olive garden i like it but i have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it.im not exactly sure what be dampen my spirit the trailer look good but the water theme be give me bad flashback to the last kevin costner movie that dealt with the subject waterworld plus despite the promise ashton kutcher show in the butterfly effect im still not completely sell on him something about the guy just annoys me probably have to do with his simian features.it take approximately two minute for my fear to subside and for my hesitancy to slip away the movie immediately throw u into the midst of a tense rescue mission and i be grip tight than kenny rogers orange face lift my concern iefly istled at kutchers initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort be make to paint him a ridiculously cool and rebellious sunglass a tough guy toothpick in his mouth and sportin a smirk thatd make george clooney proud yeah we get it i be totally ready to hate him.but then he have to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jab darn you ape man efficiently mix tense excite rescue scene drama humor and solid act the guardian be easily a film that i dare say the majority of audience will enjoy you can quibble about it clichã©s predictability and rare moment of overcooked sappiness but none of that take away from the entertainment value.i have a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when costner start train the young guy but on the contrary the training session just might be the most interesting aspect of the film coast guard rescue swimmer be hero whose story have never really be portray on the big screen so i feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it be to make it be very informative and a great way to introduce audience to this underappreciated group.do you have what it take to be a rescue swimmer just think about it you get to go on dangerous mission in cold dark rough water and then you must fight disorientation exhaustion hypothermia and a lack of oxygen all while try to help strand panicked people who be depend on you for their survival and if all that isnt bad enough sometimes you cant save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who life and who dies.man who want all that responsibility not me i have no idea what it be really like for these guy and who would have think id have an ashton kutcher/kevin costner movie to thank for the education not only do the guardian do a great job of pay tribute to this rare eed of hero but lucky for u it also do a good job of entertain it pay customers.the gist moviegoer want an inside look at what it like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give the guardian a chance i saw it for free but have i pay i wouldve felt i have get my money worth,positive
go into see seven pound i wasnt clearly sure what to think because the preview leave to much open to grasp what the movie be really about so within the first min or so you be completely lose in the plot have no idea what be go on and you think tim who claim to be ben be just a big asshole all of this come to an end when the twistso to speak be unravel at the very last minute of the movie basically tim will smith be troubled and haunt by a big accident he make cause the end of seven people live by this he decide to scope out seven new people who be in need of help badly who he in turn give his life to.the acting of this film be great a i feel will smith no matter what part he seem to impress rosario dawson to me this be one of her good movie aside from eagle eye which i think be up there to she have be in some bad some good but she do deliver in this film other actor such a woody harrelson have very small role and not a big enough role to grasp the character although the casting of the film be still good.this movie be definitely not what i expect and certainly a lot slow pace in which i hop the movie however be still pretty good nothing be reveal until the last min of the movie and everything fall into place up until then it just seem like a pointless love story final think seven pounds=seven star,positive

despite have an absolutely horrid script more about that later this film be still vaguely watchable just because it star two excellent actor barbara stanwyck and henry fonda aside from one or two real stinker id probably watch just about anything with them in the film a i be a huge fan of hollywood golden age of the s and s. however no matter how much i love their film i just cant recommend this film.the movie begin with fonda and stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort the two havent yet meet but the film begin loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which fonda horribly yodel while ski it be do so unsubtly and make my teeth grind but i stick it outespecially when fonda fell into a snow bank and this stop the yodeling in hindsight perhaps i should have just turn it off then fonda be knock out in the fall and barbara go for help back at the ski lodge he seem okay but fortunately she be also a doctor and have him xrayed and nurse him back to health he in turn becomes infatuate with her and propose to her despite hardly know each other they marry and so far the film seem like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy.once home however all isnt rosy a she jump right back into her job a a family doctor and he begin exhibit sign that he be a control and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy the film play it all for laugh but frankly fondas behavior be really creepyspying on her and her male patient attack or threaten any man she treat trip a patient who already have a back injury and stomp into a surprise party and insist that everyone there men and woman be out to steal away his wife he come off a a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic but it all suppose to be for laughs consider that he seem like a dangerous nut you would think that stanwyck would file for an annulment along with a restrain order but oddly she get mad but just cant stay mad at fonda because he so ........ i cant think of the right wordcreepy be all that come to mind later out of the blue multimillionaire fonda get a job work the counter at a department store then through magical thinking he and babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy be all a thing of the pastso a job apparently cure anger and suspicion when this job fall through the film end with fonda buy his own hospital give barbara a job there and they live happily ever after they dont go any far with the story but i assume base on fonda character that he then spend most of his time a hospital administrator beat up all the male patients.the first portion at the ski lodge and the next do not fit well together nor do the final horatio alger inspire section where the rich boy make good in the business world they be like three separate plot but despite this the most serious problem with the film be it seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy what a creepy little film thank goodness neither fonda nor stanwyck be know for this yechy film but for all their other lovely film,negative
i find the critique of many imdb user a little harsh and in many case find that they crit the movie from a very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that want to sit and watch something just to get away from it all.in this case however i have to say it be bad i be a scifi junkie and there be nothing in this movie that grab me for even one second.there be no proper storyline i may be an idiot but i still do not know where the government be that be so worried about these pieces.the pathetic attempt by the main character to put together these piece be scary half the time the two piece be already in place and he simply have to add the third a year old kid would have be able to put them together.this movie be bad.dominic,negative
i be debate between this movie and but choose inglourious basterds due to it amazingly high imdb rating i must say now what a disappointment i expect a certain amount of gratuitous violence but i also expect a lot of witty dialog i get a huge dosage of the former but not nearly enough of the latter i felt shortchanged the ratio between violence to plot be very important and i think this movie get it totally wrong and the plot it that believable or really all that entertain either save your time and money i cant believe what this rating say for the gory and violent taste of the modern mass,negative

perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movie be otto premingers where the sidewalk end from a really excellent script by ben hecht base on the novel night cry by frank rosenberg ... dana andrew be the honest tough new york policeman always in trouble with his superior because he like his own strongarm method as much a he detest crook ... when he hit someone his knuckle hurt ... and the man he want to hit be a smooth villain gary merrill who point up the title why be you always try to push me in the gutter he ask andrew i have as much right on the sidewalk a you.dana andrew obsession and neurosis be implant in his hidden painful discovery that he be the son of a thief ... his deep hatred of criminal lead him to use their own illegal method to destroy them and the pursuit of justice become spoil in private vendetta ... by a twist of irony unique to the film itself dana andrew and gene tierney of laura be united once more and andrews now seem to be play the same detective a few year later but no longer the romantic beaten down by his job by the cheap crook ... this time he go too far and accidentally kill a suspect ... the killing be accidental the victim worthless yet it be a crime that he know can eak him or send him to jail ... use his knowledge of police procedure he cover up his part in the crime plant false clue and try to implicate a gang leader but can not avoid investigate the case himself ... the double tension of follow the large case through to it conclusion without implicate himself in the murder be beautifully maintain and the final solution be both logical satisfying and in no way a compromise ... the film be one of the best detective film of the s with curious moral value also one of premingers best ... preminger use a powerful storytelling technique project pretentious camera angle and peculiar touch of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism ...,negative
in sum overlong and fill with more subplots than swiss cheese have hole the director and cowriter say he want to mix genre in this case drama and comedy well at least here these two mix like vinegar and oil to boot the comedy be not very funny and juvenile additionally the film be not really realistic liberty be take regard the legal system in commit french citizen against their will and the apparent ease of abscond with drug in french hospital i watch this film on my big screen tv at home and find myself shout at the film to move on eventually toward the end i fast forward the final long speech one of the main character make to his exlovers son by that time i be wear out by the preposterous confused plot that deal with a dead lover marriage of convenience and a nutty exlover at time the plot divert to the family of the two main character and then revert back to one of them either ismael or primarily nora to the detriment of the audience viewpoint keep change from nora and ismael her exlover confine against his will in a psychiatric hospital there probably be two potentially interesting film here neither of which be well developed the epilogue do not really wrap up many of the subplots and seem to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although give her circumstance in real life the chance be equivalent to a snow ball chance in hell the actor do their best and be appeal but this be not enough to overcome all the glare fault of poor write editing and lack of focus,negative
incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all roman emperor who go insane leave infamous party orgy and ruthless killing in his path ... i know there be several version of this and this be base on the min one that i watch but i cant fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck id heard for long about the alleged shocking content of sex/nudity which honestly there isnt much of here at all and bore when there be and blood but beware it the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shock here everything look plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project camerawork be hopelessly inept full of strange zoom fail framing and confuse pan to and from what mostly look like a huge theater stage complete with a grainy cheapish photo quality lighting and color scheme be terrible and uneven be it day or night be they in or outside have they change scene who be or be mean to be in the shot editing be the final sin here make a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaway continuity flaw and random transition that destroy any chance of momentum story progression and involvement there be potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story ... but these fault distract so much it tragic.a story with so many possibility to be great be just one gargantuan burnt and fellinilike turkey thats only good for a few gobblelaughs and peter otoole who make a most memorable tiberius oh yes which ings u to the bigname actor id like to line them all up one by one and just ask who do you get free access to bonk in the orgy to be a part of this there ive waste enough line on one of the truly bad film of all time period out of from ozjeppe,negative

most of the comment on this movie be positive so i thought i would try and redress the balance i come out of this movie wonder what be go on i now know and still consider it to be a poor movie i intially discount a dream sequence a that seem too obvious i be glad that i have a free ticket to the movie or i would have ask for my money back movie reviewer and critic love this movie which only confirm to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy a film the rating this movie have be so misleading in year time this film will not compare to true great such a the godfather the film do have fine performance from both the lead but that isnt enough to save the film nor be the lesbian scene,positive
pepe le moko play by charles boyer be some sort of international criminal mastermind want in country throughout europe and to stay free he hole himself up in the casbah a mysterious part of algiers where even the police be reluctant to go until a senior officer be send from paris to capture le moko once and for all for le moko although the casbah allow him to remain out of police custody it also become a sort of prison at the same time a place he cant leave because the moment he do he know hell be arrested.boyers performance be good and i can understand why he be nominate for an oscar he capture the essence of such a character a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time the movie itself unfortunately be quite a letdown a number of part of the story seem inconsistent of which ill mention two first be the idea that the police wouldnt enter the casbah that be state pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander and yet repeat reference in the movie suggest that in fact the police do enter the casbah fairly regularly so neither the suggestion by commissioner janvier that the police wouldnt enter nor the statement by inspector slimane also a decent performance by joseph calleia that they could get into the casbah but not out seem to make much sense i also find it difficult to believe that le moko harden criminal mastermind that he be could be so quickly sweep off his foot by gaby hedy lamarr to the point where he entertain the local populace by sing love song and then leave the casbah to find her essentially give himself up i understand the irony of the final few scene of course a pepe leave the freedom of his prison the casbah only to find real freedom in his capture because he shot and kill by the police i just find it impossible to believe that someone like le moko would fall into such a trap.this be worth watch for boyer and to a less extent calleia but the story be disappointing and inconsistent,neutral
man with the scream brain certainly isnt a perfect movie but im pretty sure it be never mean to be anything more than a star vehicle for bruce campbell mean it work a kind of a summary of his entire career slapstick sarcasm cheese action and happy ending campbell be a a writer uneventhere be lot of thing in the story that dont make a great deal of sense why do the robot suddenly have east merely because a female ain have be implant into it and some of the scene feel like retread of other good incarnation the scene in the restaurant where yegor and william battle for control of williams body be straight out of evil dead ii there be however lot of little touch and nonsequiturs that feel rather illiant such a when william be in the height of his panic and scream at a statue what be you look at the movie look like a scifi channel original probably because it be the acting be actually pretty good i particularly enjoy tamara gorski a tatoya she be ruthless and cunning yes but seem to have a tragic air about her in certain moment that the story never explore ted raimi handle the standard bumbling assistant role admirably enough and bruce be funny a the arrogant sardonic condescend american jerk now that he write his own film youd think hed give himself a role that he hasnt be typecast in already man with the scream brain be a bizarre nonsensical bmovie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid take a cinematic experience too seriously,positive

tell the truth iâ€™m a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people which be also the main reason why i actually decide to see this movie and after have see it i be really a disappointed and this come from the guy that love this genre of movie.iâ€™m surprise at this movie all completely â€ “ it be like a kidâ€™s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little child curse and swear iâ€™m not at all righteous but this have really go too far in my account.synopsis the story about two guy get send to the big other program for their reckless behavior there they meet up with one kid with boobs obsession and the other be a medieval freak.just the name it self be not really connect with the story at all they be not be a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have do the story be very predictable though expect and the humor be lame and havenâ€™t we already see the same character play by mc lovinâ€™ in so many other movie like sasquatch gang i think i laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep.well the casting be alright after all he be the one that produce the screenplay and the acting be soso a expect when youâ€™re watch this type of movie and the direction what do one expect this be the same guy who ought u wet hot american summer and that movie also suck but somehow he always manage to ing in some star to attract his horrendous movie.anyway i felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time only the naked scene seem to be the best part in the movie canâ€™t really see any point why i should recommend this to anyone.pros elizabeth bank two topless scenes.cons not funny dreadful story nudity and kid do not mix together.rating grade f,positive
this film hold my interest enough to watch it several time the plot have hole but the lead performer make it work.catherine mary stewart julia keridge do a great job a a woman of who have sacrifice everything else to become a physician she work year to earn the money to go to medical school she be perform illiantly in her residency and be just about to take her board exam and realize her dream.meanwhile julias sister and otherinlaw be murder and a the near living relative she be compel to take in her niece amanda arlen aguayostewart to avoid have her become a ward of the state amanda be about year old from her appearance amanda be so traumatized from her parent murder that she have become mute needless to say julias hour day get long care for amanda.rob lowe play kevin finney a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who work his way into the life of julia and amanda he be always there with a trick or a joke to help amanda deal with her distress amanda really start to warm up to kevin a the film progress perhaps more than to her aunt julia start to rely on kevin to take some of the load of care for amanda a she attempt to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination kevin be always there whenever some crisis erupts for julia.the chemistry between rob and catherine mary be great you keep watch to see them get together before the end of the film the chemistry between rob and arlen be good as well arlen manage to convey quite a lot without the benefit of word the plot have julia and amanda gradually warm up to each other you can see them work out a relationship a the film progresses.we discover that julias sister and otherinlaw the meyers be involve in industrial espionage they steal an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer they have three associate who intend to share the proceeds of the theft julia discovers that the meyers be plan to skip the country under assumed identity the plot be unclear whether the meyers intend to double cross their associate or be themselves double crossed.in any case the meyers be murder in their home by of their former associate the killer make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the meyers before kill them the killer search the home and fail to find their prize they leave a living witness to their crime amanda the killer then spend the remainder of the film make clumsy attempt to extract the microchip from julia and amanda who have no idea where the prize be locate eventually the killer kidnap amanda in hope she know something about the microchip location.eventually julia discovers the truth about kevin he be an investigator hire to recover the steal microchip after some rough moment in the relationship they manage to rescue amanda and dispatch the bad guy the predictable end have the three form a family and move happily into a future together.what strike me about the plot be major hole kevin move into the same apartment building a julia and amanda the day after the murder of the meyers how do he know that the microchip be not already in the hand of the killer the killer blithely leave fingerprint at the murder scene with no concern for conceal their identity the killer that pretend to be a psychiatrist be reveal to amanda by the remnant of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe sol he be not show in the murder scene at the start of the film there be other weakness along these line too numerous to mention.the film could have be a lot well if the script have be refine more before film filling in the plot hole would have add little expense and greatly improve the effort,negative
like the previous poster i be from northern vermont and i be incline to like this film however not since red zone cuba have i see such a confusing plot the thing the people to bootleg make no sense two of the gang paddle across the border send a second party across in a car uhm why then they meet two others and drive up at night in to the bad guy hideout in a luxury packard wouldnt just two people in a flatbed truck make more sense then park outside the garage that hold the targeted hooch the four fall asleep when they waken in the morning and and start haul the whiskey out of course theyre spot and shot at lose some of their precious cargo in the process then two of the smuggler put the whiskey in a boat and float it over the border again why i be tell by someone whose great uncle really do smuggle in the area all one need be to drive a vehicle that could outrun than the u.s. canada border patrol which back then have a fraction of the resource it have now and dont get me start on the last half hour which make no sense whatsoever.the only good thing i can say about the film be that kris kristopherson have actually grow some charisma with the year,neutral

watch this last night and be bowl over by the heartfelt story line the excellent character development and the good karmic vibe emanate from the acting and movie a a whole.without give away too much of the plot it begin with an ordinary joe who commute to his office job every day who become inspire to take dance lesson along the way the protagonist and the assorted character he meet in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lesson about others and about themselves the story have a prologue about what dance in japan symbolize sociologically so it isnt exactly as simple to learn to dance in japan a it be here in the u.s. the film be lighthearted youll laugh out loud at some of the sight gag yet it be also dignify in a way hard to describe all of the film character be take seriously a they be and none be diminish because of their imperfections.ive be think about take social dance class with some friend it just so happen a friend lent me the video on learn to dance be this synchronous or what i think so because now im really geeked to give it a try watch this wonderful family film small child might not get it but teens certainly would and smile at the genuine caring you see show in it time and again.why they would make a remake of shall we dance be a mystery a it be perfect asis,positive

it get to be a running joke around bonanza about how fatal it be for any woman to get involve with any cartwright men after all ben cartwright be three time a widower with a son by each marriage and any woman who get involve with adam ho and little joe be go to end up die because we couldnt get rid of the formula of the widower and the three son that start this classic tv western.perhaps if bonanza be be do today the writer would have have revolving woman character who come in and out of the life of the cartwright people have relationship some go good some not so good it just life and be less demanding of our hero today so if a relationship with one of them go south we dont have to kill the character off to keep the survivor nobility intact but thats if bonanza be do today.but we be still expect a lot from our western hero and bonanza though it take a while to take hold and a change of view time from nbc certainly help the secret of bonanza success be the noble patriarch ben cartwright and his stalwart son ben cartwright be the ideal tv dad in any genre you want to name his whole life be spend in the hard work of building that immense ponderosa spread for his three child the kid be all different in personality but all come together in a pinch.the cartwright become and still be an american institution i daresay more people care about this family than the kennedy just the popularity that bonanza have in syndication testifies to that pernell roberts a old son adam be write out of the show rumor have it he didnt care for the noble cartwright character which he felt border on sanctimonious perhaps if it be do now hed have like it well in the way i describe.this be just the beginning for michael landon how many people get three hit tv show to their credit landon also have highway to heaven and little house on the prarie where he have creative control little joe be the young most hot head but the most romantic of the cartwright when robert leave the show keep go with the two young son but when big dan blocker leave the heart go out of bonanza other character have be add on by that time david canary tim matheson and ben cartwright adopt young mitch vogel but big loyal but a little thick ho be easily the most lovable of the cartwright his sudden demise after surgery leave too big a hole in that family.so the cartwright of the ponderosa have pass into history i get a real taste of how america take the cartwright to heart when i visit the real virginia city it doesnt look anything like what you see in bonanza but near lake tahoe just about where you see the ponderosa on the map at the opening credit be the cartwright home the set maintain and open a a tourist attraction like baker street for sherlock holmes fan the ranchhouse and the cartwright be real.and if they werent real they should have be,positive
year ago when darling lili play on tv it be always the pan and scan version which i hat and decide to wait and see the film in it proper widescreen format so when i saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews/blake edward opus i decide to purchase and watch it once and for all.boy what a terrible film it so bad and on so many level that i really do not know where to start in describe where and when it go so horribly wrong look at it now it obvious to any fan of movie that blake edward create this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other director have strike gold with andrew in musical mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrew be snub from star in project make famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood think she wasnt sexy or glamorous enough so blake create this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical darling lili suffers from multiple personality never know who or what it be some specific scene be good or effective but a a whole it just doesnt work at all to a point of it be very embarrassing.mind you the version on the dvd be the director cut or in this case let salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in release the dvd edward cut scene from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film move along with no idea of what it be we be minute into it and we still dont know whats go on or why be watch whats go what kind of spy be lili how powerful be she be she ever responsible for someone death instead we watch a thoroughly bore look rock hudson try to woo a thoroughly bore look julie andrew thing arent help much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why do julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she get involve with there should have be one of her ex hang around try to win her back or try to decipher her secret this would have give u some much need contrast to the muddle action it would also have give u some impetuous to the sluggish proceeding theres no catalyst in this story.one only have to look at the cut scene to clearly see that edward and the writer just come up with idea inspire by andrew and edward previous successes the best or bad example be the scene when andrew and hudson follow a group of child who sing in the middle of a forest edward channel sound of music it no wonder he remove it from the dvd back in that scene might have work on a certain level but today that moment reek of desperation there be other plot element directly inspire by andrews/edwards other film the endless scene of dogfight be inspire by the much good modern millie the musical moment ill give you three guess be create just to make fun of july mary poppins persona which be turn raunchy with julie do a striptease in the act the end bird eye view of julie run towards hudson plane be another wink at sound of music.the whole thing be confuse julie play a singer bear from a german father and british mother who live in england but sing her english song in paris you never know exactly where the story take place some moment be just badly edit like when julie and her uncle be on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprint off in midsentence im like what happen here the comedy bit be unfunny and cringeworthy every scene with the french police be pathetic wheres peter seller when you really need him the action be stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle be on their way to germany on that train hudson squadron shoots round of bullet at the train almost kill lili in the process brilliant whats also funny about that scene be the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning thats one slow move train there the musical moment the beginning be the best part of the entire film and the reason i give this film star but it effect be diminish considerably because it repeat at the end speaking of redundant do we really need to see a cancan dance crepe suzette strip scene and julie strip too the girl in no man land be ok even if it bleeding obvious but that moment just doesnt make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldier at a french hospital make me wonder how many soldier there be injure indirectly by the result of her spy the whole project be listless and without energy the romance be unbelievable rock hudson be way too old and tire look check out the museum scene julie look daze like shes on valium but what really kill this illconceived project be julie play a german spy edward desperately want to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflict his wife and believe that play a traitor be a good career decision as much a i like julie shes no greta garbo who pull it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie play a german spy she still come across a cloying and cute.how bad be darling lili even after year since it release blake edward felt he still need to work on it for it dvd release,positive
this series make for televisiã³n espaã±ola tve be basically a series of chapter in the life of an ordinary family in primarily a see through the eye of the young son.based on a background of historical event such a the may student uprise in france the decay franco regime the war in vietnam the rise of imperialism and others specifically relate to spanish life at that particular moment one might regard this series a a simple compilation of characteristic foible which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment.generally treat in a lightweight vein though not lack in certain moment which might be call dramatic the series would seem to be aim at people of around fifty who can rember those time a it should be state anyone young either chooses to ignore such happening or be busily occupy in other things.the best thing that can be say of this series be ana duatos rã´le a mother of three child she play the part of the total housewife of the time really well manifest that peculiar spanish penchant especially noticeable among woman of let all her thinking and her doings be carry forward by the impetus of her heart without any resorting to the use of the ain a we say in spain common sense be one of the least common sens imanol arias offer very little apart from not be his usual stereotype hard policeman a in other television series indeed a an actor he should not be trust in anything which be not a tv series his resource be too limited however his part a father of the workingclass household be not at all bad.not really recommendable for other audience even spanishspeakers in latin america the theme be all too parochially relate to a specific spot in contemporary spanish history such that if the viewer be not live here at that time he will miss most of the reference it be even probable that certain situation which cause a few spanish smile would not mean anything to other viewer,negative

one of my favorite movie which have be overlook by too many movie goer an observation which mystifies me not only direct by the acclaimed ang leeit have many young actor who be to become major star e.g tobey maguire before spiderman skeet ulrich before jericho jonathan rhys meyers before tudor james caviezel simon baker mark ruffalo jeffrey wright tom wilkinson and jewel all of the acting be superb and each of the actor mention give memorable performance especially meyers who portray an evil villain who kill for the sake of killing.when the biography and accomplishment of the director even when he win an academy award and the actor be list this film be usually omit from their past performance i discover the film on dvd by accident and it become one of my most often watched film however it be seldom every see on cable i look forward to read what others suggest be the reason this film be not well know,negative
it nice to see a romantic comedy that do not have the prissy man lead this have solid act from both male lead and also from the female lead and although the story be a little long and a little clichã© you cant help but like it.i think the story be a little rush at the end but extend that would have make the story even longer superior to other romantic comedy such a day with mr arrogant and possibly tie with my tutor friend.it would make an interesting introduction to korean cinema not as great a my sassy girl but still good,positive
of all the movie of the seventy none capture to truest essence of the good versus evil battle a do the sentinel i mean yes there be movie like the exorcist and other one but none of them capture the human element of the protagonist like this one if you have time check this one out you may not be able to get past the dated device a such but this be a story worth get into.then there be all the star and soontobe star my absolute favorite be eli wallach sylvia mile and burgess meredith then there be the subtle clue that lead to whats go on too pay close attention i have to watch it four time to catch on to all the small weird statement like black and white cat black and white cake plus the book be really good a well im just sorry that theyre not go to turn the second book into a film it so scary that it would outdo this movie,positive
this be apparently the second remake of this film have be film before in and and in so many way it remind me of the late film a yank at oxford both film concern a conceited blowhard who arrive at one of the top school in the world and both ultimately show the blowhard slowly learn about teamwork and decency in this film william haines be tom brown and his main rival bob be play by france x. bushman and in a supporting role be jack pickfordalways remember a the other of mary of these three pickford come off the best a the sympathetic loser who become tom palhe actually have a few decent scene as well a a dramatic moment just before the big game all the standard clichã©s be there and the movie because it be do so many time before and since offer few surprise however it be pleasant film and be enjoyable viewing.in my opinion for a good silent college film try harold lloyd the freshmanits football scene be frankly more exciting and harold be far more likable and sympathetic than the annoy tom brown the freshman be probably the best college picture you can find from the era another reason why brown at harvard be a less picture be that william haines play essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again such a in westpoint and the smart set among others and if youve see one of these film youve see them all well make but certainly not original and because it be just a rehash of his other film anyone give the film a score of be strongly advise to see these other films.//==i just check and saw this this small film be the high rat film on imdb from the talk about overrate there be dozen and dozen of good filmshow this film get to be be anyones guess,positive
this movie illustrate like no other the state of the australian film industry and everything thats hold it back.awesome talent outstanding performance particularly by victoria hill but a let down in practically every other way.an adaptation of sort it ought nothing new to macbeth no set it in presentday australia be not enough and essentially completely fail to justify it existence apart from let face it completely unnecessarily pay homage to the original work if there one body of work that have be do and do and do and do it shakespeare so any adaptation if it not to be a selfindulgent and pointless exercise need to at least ing some new interpretation to the work.and thats what this macbeth fail to do a it be do this film have no contemporary relevance whatsoever it the same piece that we have see countless too many time before except with gun and in different outfits.apart from the fundamental blunder no other way to put it of keep the original shakespearian dialogue one of the more cringeful moment of the movie be the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end during which i completely tune out even though i be look at the screen i never think i have a short attention span but there you go.i suppose the movie succeed on it own very limited term but a australia continue to produce worldclass act talent it moviemakers need to stop be proud of succeed on limited term and actually set high enough standard to show that they respect for the kind of act talent they work with.a shame an absolute shame,negative

im a big fan of surrealist art but this film by bunuel with some idea from dali leave me cold bunuel have a lifelong grudge against the catholic church and delight in try to offend catholic in fairly silly way this be one of the silly almost like what youd expect from a smartaleck yearold in film class the last few minute of the movie which have nothing to do with anything else be a final nosethumbing at religion.if you read the scholar regard this slowpaced occasionally amusing film it all about how the church and society be guilty of sexual repression if that be indeed the point then bunuel express it in the most roundabout fashion possible the central male character be a nasty ute who love kick dog and knock blind men down in the street and who mentally turn billboard ad into strange sexual fantasy be this behavior the church fault for interrupt his lovemaking or be he just a jerk i vote for the latter i think bunuel must have have a lot of personal hangups and choose the catholic a the one to blame.there be a few moment where you might cry aha surrealism a cow in a bed a giraffe fall out a window a poor model a man shred a feather pillow a woman flush a toilet while we watch picture of seethe lava or a mud pit ... hard to tell in b/w the rest be forgettable selfindulgence unfortunately bunuel be still chase the same bogeyman through the rest of his career viridiana discreet charm ... if youre interested in see surrealism on the screen check out jean cocteau early work,negative

pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion/philosophy the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what be say about quantum physic in this mess be just plain wrong.examples quantum theory support the idea in eastern religion that reality be an illusion how well in the world of the subatomic you can never definitely predict a particle location at a specific time you can only give the odds of it be precisely at one spot at one time also the act of observation seem to affect the event solid particle can pass through barrier all of this so far be accurate but then they assert that that mean that if you believe sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall you could indeed do it this be complete poppycock instead the theory assert that at our level it be possible for you to walk through a wall but it be merely by chance and have nothing to do with belief also youd have to keep walk into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remote chance of pass through the wall the odds be so astronomically against it.this be but one example of how they misrepresent the science but much more annoying be the narrative involve an unhappy photographer play by marlee maitlan about halfway through the picture it become so confused a to be incomprehensible something to do with negative thought lead to addiction and selfhate there may be some truth to that but quantum physic have nothing to do with it.plus string theory be the hot new thing in physic nowadays instead of waste your time with this dreck i suggest you rent the elegant universe an amazing series do for nova on pb that give you a history of physic from newton and gravity to ed witten and m theory in only hourlong episode quantum mechanic be explain there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation,positive

youd think youre in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie take place primarily between two character a they travel mile or so from france to saudi arabia go through most of europe italy bulgaria croatia slovenia turkey before arrive in the middle east but this be not a tour and there be no stopover for soak in the sights.redas father be in his twilight year and wish to do the haj however since walking and take the mule be out of the question he choose to travel to mecca by car he cant drive and therefore enlist the help of reda to his son protest to get him there in their oken down vehicle.but reda doesnt see the point of have him go along when his dad could opt for the plane he resent the idea of have put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldnt understand and hence we set off in this arduous journey with father and son be not the best of pals.the beauty of this movie be to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenge they face the weird people they meet have to duke it out in varied weather condition and alternate rest stop between motel and sleep in the car we see an obvious generation gap in them try to communicate to each other the father try to impose on his son and the son try to assert himself a an adult but circumstance we see reveal that reda be quite a fish out of water through the many encounter they actually team up quite well despite their differences.its perhaps quite apt to have this film release here last week to coincide with hari raya haji and have the opportunity to watch our protagonist join the other pilgrim in their haj the final scene in mecca be truly a sight to behold and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear a reda try to hunt down his dad amongst the thousand of people congregate the sight of europe be perhaps deliberately not dwell upon so a to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination.it certainly ring home the thought of tell and show love one how much you appreciate them for who they be dont miss this and yes book early i be pleasantly surprise that this evening session be still a full house,positive
i watch this movie base on the good review here and i wont make that mistake again.the first couple minute show that a group of people have be ought together by some tragedy but you dont see what it be flashback hour and we get to see the boring life of each of these people which in the end be totally meaningless to what be about to happen when the end be finally revel you realize that you just waste an hour of your life wait for a big payoff that doesnt happen and mean nothing to what you have be watch the only connection these people have be that they have all have a bad daybut even that continuity get lose in the boredom.if this be suppose to be a crash clone it a complete failure,negative

okay ive watch this movie twice now i have research it heavily on the net i have ask several people on there opinion i have even go to the length of read the original sheridan lafanu classic carmilla a book that this movie be suppose to be base on i feel that the best way to review this movie be to describe a game to play whilst watch it a the plot of the movie doesnt seem to make any sense at all here be the plot of the book.laura live in a castle in syberia with her father mr de lafontaine they carry on with their life blissfully and peacefully one day they get a letter from the general a man who have make it his mission in life to avenge his daughter death he make claim of supernatural power be at work and explain that he will visit them soon meanwhile a chance encounter with a strange woman result in the lafontaines look after her daughter carmilla for several month soon laura start to be overwhelm by strange dream and begin to come down with a strange illness who be this mysterious carmilla and just what have she to do with lauras condition and the general i have invent this game and would like a many people a possible to play it and let me know what their result be i even have a catchy name and would have a jingle too but i cant be bother with that it call the this movie doesnt make any sense game.all you have to do be whilst watch the movie try to come up with a complete plot that explain what be happen i mean complete all question answer everything make sense absolutely complete.it will have to answer such question a ... why can vampires walk around in day light why be they all lesbian why be a girl call bob and why do she shoot herself when be the movie a dream and when be it real why do kill zombie appear to be an accepted part of life that doesnt make anyone bat an eyelid why do travis fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slow down whilst drive his car yet when face with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car accept the excuse that she be a zombie too and why do he then let a girl which he later openly reveal that he know be the head vampire drive with him in his car and then let her drive off alone with his daughter in a stolen car what the hell be the asylum scene all about what the hell be the green goo all about why do the head vampire suddenly start dress like a nurse why be there never any vampire fight zombie what be the significance of the necklace what be it make of why do it kill vampire and how do jenna know that in fact sod it it just as much fun try to come up with as many question about this movie too.i have my plot and i have to admit it be not quite there but it be a pretty good effort.in conclusionvampires vs zombie have no moment in it where there be actually vampire fight zombie everyone in the movie seem to know exactly what be go on yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this and somehow it be base on a classic th century horror novel how why what the hell be go on,negative
this wouldve be a great silent film the act really be good at least in a look ma im do really big act sort of way.everything be huge every line be profound every scene be shatter by human tragedy mostly i felt like gag yet like any train wreck i couldnt tear my eye away this dialogue mightve work on the stage although i doubt it on the screen it be clutter haphazard hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work.if you enjoy your melodrama in huge heaping dos you might enjoy the movie be prepare to wait however for all that melodrama this thing sure plod along at it own pace.this script mustve sound a lot different when the actor involve be read it to themselves it simply doesnt work once they get around to deliver it in front of the camera.imdb do u a great disservice at time when it use it goofy computercontrolled weight score curse of the starve class deserve less than a .characterdriven fiction be great but when you develop your character by simply push them through hoop with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution it isnt character development your character must have a motivation be drunk for a while and wake up in a field be not character development thats a plot contrivance.stay away from this movie or at the very least watch it mute perhaps youll get some amusement from all the armwaving the character do.oh and word to the wise to prove that this be truly an artsy film you see james wood in all his dangly male lookatme imthefigurativeandliteralrepresentationofthenakedvulnerabilityof man glory.dont say you werent warn,positive
this movie start with the main character lie in a coma in a hospital ward attend by two orderly the unconscious main character be hear in a voice over say that the orderly be gay the orderly kiss i watch this in a dvd version and i have the suspicion that this be suppose to be funny â– it say â „ comedy on the dvd case after all and it go on like that have i see this in a movie theater i probably would have hear part of the audience roar with laughter because it be so funny â– and because they be suppose to sit in a comedy while it be fascinate to think about what it be funny and what isnt this movie unfortunately only deliver argument about what isnt.brilliant ains can make anything funny people like ernst lubitsch billy wilder or mel brook have prove that fact but you have to know the â „ mechanic i suppose director and coscriptwriter dani levy do not bother about those mechanic he think that certain thing simply be funny the fact that two orderly be gay and kiss over a man in a coma for example do not get me wrong some people can make that funny dani levy cant not for me anyway.the main problem i have with this movie be that i cant see a reason behind the way the main character behave i could not understand why the two others one an orthodox jew from west germany one a third class carbon copy of fast eddie felson from former east germany so strongly dislike each other they be both rather bland character their child be bore apart from the fact that they be sexually attract to each other well one be a lesbian now but raise the daughter she have with her cousin but even these incestuous relationship â– if anything they be embarrass just come through a an excuse because the scriptwriter could not come up with anything better.the acting be not bad udo semel i actually come to like quite a lot although he remind me more of ex chancellor helmut kohl a light version than of a venerable orthodox jew the direction in itself be not really bad either but maybe levy should stick to direct movie leave the scriptwriting to someone else now i heard he do a comedy about hitler oi vai,positive

first and foremost i love the novel by ray bradbury it the kind of horror that get under your skin and stick with you later it be one of his best book with you know fahrenheit and dandelion wine i a just hop that this movie would be all right it have lot of chance with a great cast like jason robards and jonathn pryce and bradbury even write the script himself and on top of all that it have pam grier how could it fail there may be spoiler within.first of all it be dumbed down much of the horror from the book be lose a bradbury must have be force to keep the violence to a minimum all the visuals from the book ... go everything that make you squirm ... gone.and then theres the act like a lot of movie that disney throw out in the s the kid in this movie can not act and this bug me a lot neither of them look but or their strong friendship wasnt address it be more like they be acquaintaces youd think jason robards and jonathan pryce could pull this off in their role of mr. halloway and mr. dark but here it like they just dont care all they want to do be somehow pay off some mortgage or something this be far from be some of their best performance pam grier be fine a the witch but the charecter of the dust witch herself wasnt well pull off shes a lot less evil and doesnt have the presence a she do in the book and everything that be leave out of the book the ballon night chase the marking of jims house the real death of mr. dark what happen to mr. coogan on the merrygoround the fate of the lightening rod salesman the real death of the witch and oh so much more and the special effect be bad even for the s. the merrygoround of doom for one thing with the superimposed horse go around wasnt really creepy and that weird green mist that really have nothing to do with anything i could keep go about how this movie rip apart the original novel but it make blood boil dont see this movie but read the book it a classic of bradbury,negative

i have eagerly await the first screening of this film ever since it be give to me on dvd at christmas have reserve a special slot for it last night i sit down to watch it with my daughter age and a film study student with chocolate of course in eager anticipation we love jane austin.after just the first two minute we know we be sink the shaky camera shot and angle general poor cinematography direction and wooden performance have already leave u feel flat and dissatisfied despondent we view on.anne play by sally hawkins look oddly and with no particular purpose directly at the camera on several occasion eaking our hardwon fantasy of the moment and engage u directly in an almost ill find you stalk fashion.poor rupert penryjones who play captain wentworth do his best with the script and direction bless him i hope they pay him well however a he be practically drown on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably eached the seawall drench him and his coactor they be nearly sweep out to sea health and safety would have have a field day poor rupert be leave spit out sea water in order to deliver his line presumably there be not enough money leave in the kitty for a reshoot of this scene anyone with any sense would have not attempt it on such a day in the first place.other than mr. penryjones alice krige give the only convincing performance a lady russell but her effort be soon counterbalance by those of anthony head unconvincing portrayal of annoy sir walter elliott.towards the longawaited end of the film captain wentworth appear to oddly grace anne with a visit every two second have take great pain to avoid her for the majority of the movie it be a if he have develop a memory impediment which cause him to forget his very reason for be in contrast anne run hyperventilate from pillar to post in search of the good captain who in the meantime have manage to call upon almost the entirety of bath we be tell in the course of only three or four minute without even have work up a sweat.we experience none of anne charm cross the screen indeed we be leave wonder what charismatic captain wentworth have ever see in plain spineless opinionless anne and why someone anyone do not tell mean wing sir walter to just shut the heck up.the crucial kiss normally our favourite girlie moment be painfully draw out a they move in closer anne keep opening and closing her mouth which have the effect on screen of make her look a if she be chew gum before lip finally meet eww the most enjoyable thing about last night be the chocolate and the half hour exchange of view between mother and daughter on just how bad the film have been.what a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engage story film in some of england fine scenery.sorry jane,negative
if you like scifi monster and ancient legend then you will love this movie the special effect be by far the best i have see since juarassic park hit the big screen year ago while the acting may have be a little less than desirable the story line and effect adequately compensate for it.i wish now i have see this at the movie on a theater screen instead of our inch big screen tv.if you like nonstop action awesome visuals and taste for myth and lore .... you have to see this movie,positive

this be an ok adaptation of the eath take book of dan brown i cant say it be novel or very good but they make a movie that you can enjoy give the excellent story the result could have be well though the movie be pretty long but at the end i be feel like some thing be miss sound effect and sound track be very good acting be well do but the character development phase be very weak for people who didnt read the book thing may look happen too quickly from my point of view instead of try to put as much a stuff from the book they could have try to do the important scene more proper what make the book very good be all the puzzle like story combine with the excellent portrait of vatican you see neither of it in the movie too much rush and use the time not in a good way these be main problem of the movie so it be worth watch but could have be do well,positive
i never fell asleep during a movie never this movie do the impossible.while many people claim the superiority of japanese horror film over their american counterpart this movie be a lesson in over abundance a in the movie be minute too long it would have help if the movie have a little more movement in the plot and the camera work but instead all we get be awkward silence and a lot of slow movement the acting be absolutely terrible border on bad student film level while everyone struggle to adlib something call a script do these people even get any direction be they coax to be boring and dull either therory wouldnt surprise me.what be even bad be the rather unscary makeup involve with the creature from the other side either way they all stink dont watch this film thats all i can say unless youre an insomniac,negative
what can i say not as bad a many here have make it out to be the only reason i even watch this film that i have previously never heard of before be strictly for ian mcshane.i be not disappoint in the least ian mcshane be absolutely illiant and ings an amazing subtlety to his role he always great to watch and for my money ... an extremely underused actor.as for the rest of the film .... every other actor in the movie deliver strong solid performance these people certainly werent be pay huge amount of cash for their participation a this be a fairly low budget film but this do not mean that any of them mail their appearance in everyone be convince and compel with the part give to them.i be even pleasantly surprise at adrian paul performance though i must admit i have only ever see him in the highlander television series before this movie.the plot be well pace and the storyline intriguing and much like real life not everything end up tie in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film anybody who expect a clearcut bythenumbers connect the dots conclusion or answer at the end of the movie ... clearly wasnt watch the film closely enough this film be not go to tell you what the meaning of life be the idea be that after see the film you might go and discuss the unanswered question with your friend over a coffee i certainly did.no car chase ... no explosion ... no bar room awls .... sound pretty dull huh but the reality be that i be completely absorb by the film and it just a well write little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performance by all party involve warn ... if youre the kind of person who dislike movie that dangle an enormous question a the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answer that particular question directly ... you might not enjoy this film,positive

day of heaven be one of the most painfully boring and pointless film i have ever see in no way shape or form would i recommend it to anyone ... unless youre try to put your kid to sleep or god forbid give someone an aneurysm if i could go back in time and do one thing i would set fire to the reel before they be send to theater why day of heaven plot be simple but extremely vague long sequence devoid of dialogue compose much of the film the character be too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with the climax of the story do not touch you by this time your ain have work so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphor that your ability to think be go the only thing work be your eye and unfortunately your ear who must listen to the sound of linda the little girl in the story who talk like a man i be now dumber for see this movie dont let it happen to you,negative
in director walt disney and animator ub iwerks change the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their silly symphony series the skeleton dance iwerks and disney have be collaborate together since the early s in disneys laughogram cartoon series however their friendship suffer a tremendous blow when iwerks accept an offer by a competitor to leave disney and start his own animation studio that be the birth of celeity production where iwerks continue develop his style and technique and where he create the character of flip the frog while his work keep the same high quality it wasnt really popular and by the studio be close later that year iwerks be hire by columbia picture and iwerks decide to return to his old skeleton for another dance this time in color.s skeleton frolic be essentially a remake of the classic the skeleton dance the movie that borough him fame and fortune like that short film it be set on an abandon graveyard where at midnight the creature of the night come alive and begin to play the dead rise from their coffin ready for the show thats about to begin a a group of skeleton have form an orchestra and begin to play a happy tune now it not easy to be a musician made of just bone a some of the orchestra member have problem with their body part however the band manage to put a good show and another group of skeleton begin to dance a lovely couple of them face the same problem that trouble the orchestra it hard to dance with loose body part everything end at dawn and just when the sun be about to rise again the skeleton run towards their graves.directed and animate by ub iwerks himself skeleton frolic follow faithfully the pattern set by the skeleton dance year before although with a crucial difference iwerks do the whole film in technicolor the ight tonality allow iwerks to create a more visually appeal film and also to use the many new technique he have be practice since leave disney create even well effect of depth and dynamism than those he conceive before it be certainly a more experimental film than the skeleton dance although sadly this doesnt mean it necessarily a good film for starter the film be practically identical to the one he do with disney with the only difference be the music more on that later and the color effect it look beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feel kind of unoriginal after all.however it be not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurt the film after all iwerks execute it in a wonderful way but the fact that the musical melody create by joe denat for the film be pretty uninteresting and lack the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one do by carl w. stall for the skeleton dance in other word while denats tune be effective and appropriate for the theme it easy to forget about it rapidly while stalling song have a unique personality that make it unforgettable be a musical film this be of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music ings down iwerks flawless work of animation personally i think that with a good musical accompaniment skeleton frolic would be remember as fondly a the skeleton dance despite not be as groundeaking a it still a fun film to watch.its kind of sad that most of the work iwerks do after leave disney be now forget due to his poor success however it must be say that if iwerks lack the popularity of disney or fleischer disney main rival he do not lack the quality of those company film it be probably just a case of bad luck what make the man who give life to disneys mouse for the first time to face failure out of disney despite it shortcoming skeleton frolic be a very funny and visually eathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film one just cant help but thinking of the skeleton dance while watch it it definitely remind u that iwerks skeleton be still here to haunt u and inspire us./,positive

i have be amaze by director antals kontroll back in his first american project vacancy be less impressive but a decent start armor be his second feature and while the visual signature be recognizable the film never rise above the level of a b movie it a shame because the main premise have all the ingredient for twist and turn and the ensemble cast feature many quality actor should be able to deliver antal could have make a great heist film but instead go for an action flick then again he could have shoot a cool action flick but it doesnt really deliver in that department either what you be leave with be one implausible situation after another a group of poorly sketch character bicker and fight over a sum of money if you look past the sharp cinematography cast and the tight music score youre leave with what could have be a below average directtovideo feature van damme or seagal this be probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time,negative
first of all the reason im give this film star instead of be because at least peter falk give his usual fantastic performance a lieutenant columbo he alone can get star for try to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at make a movie.i be initially all fire up at read one poster comment that andrew stevens in this movie give the performance of his career to me it be the abysmal performance by stevens that absolutely ruin this movie and so i be all prepared to hurl all sort of insult at the person who make the aforementioned comment then i think to myself what else have stevens do so i checked and you know that person be absolutely right in the year since this columbo movie be make apparently every one of the project that stevens have be in since then have be utter crap so it be doubtful that anybody have even see the rest of his career.if you like columbo see every other of the title before watch this one do yourself a favor and save the bad for last,negative

i decide to watch this one because it be nominate for oscar this year i guess a many folk here i really want to like this movie but end up bored and disappointed first scene be ok but the whole rest of the movie in shaky hand camera mode be really annoying.i guess the main reason for make such a movie and nominate it for oscar be this american military machine people who make money on war urgently need an excuse or justification of war in iraq by bungle up something sort of patriotic.why these heroic effort of director and the main character to _inspire_ the audience with an idea of lovingwarlikeadrug .. oh please come on what a bore watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall ...,negative
mom should really be give a different title to distinguish it from all the other movie out there call mom or with the word mom in the title.this be a vastly superior zombie movie to so much of the rubbish that get churn out time after time and all end up much the same a every other zombie movie out there.it be so different and refresh it almost defy categorisation.the kind old lady who take in a creepy lodger who just happen to be a flesh eater who then infect the old lady who also turn into a flesh eating zombie or ghoul quite which exactly be not defined.there be pathos in the story a her son realise what she have become and while at first horrify attempt to help her by supply food i shall say no more about that for fear of insert a spoiler it be one of those quiet movie a oppose to gun blast explosion rag car chase etc bore etc that make so many movie all the same rubbish but still with enough gory moment to satisfy horror fan whilst also insert sadness into the story along with nice touch of humour a oppose to downright silliness of some socalled horror movies.there be a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film where the old lady be sit alone in her room with only her christmas tree for company and look so innocent but what she become oh my a gem of a movie and even if not your thing should at least be view if only once by any true horror fan,positive
empire of passion start out deceptively that be if youre immediately expect it to be a horror movie it like a riff on james m. cains the postman always ring twice at first seki kazuko yoshiyuki be a mother of two and a dutiful hardworking wife to rickshaw driver gisaburo takahiro tamura but when he not around and shes at home with the baby the feisty and aimless young man toyoji tatsuya fuji come around to ing some goody for seki ... and a little extra theyre soon sleep together but after he do something to her let just say a shave he know that hell find out and immediately propose that they kill gisaburo they drink him up strangle him and then toss him down a well naturally this will come back to haunt them but that it literally at least to them at first superterrified seki and then only later on skeptical toyoji change gear into the kaidan a japanese ghost story.this be a film where the horror come not simply out of oh ghost ah but out of the total dread that build for the character in a way theres the mechanic of a filmnoir at work throughout if only loosely translate by way of a th century japanese village a oppose to an american city or small town i.e the snoop cop the evidence find possibly by another word get around suspicion arouse etc it compelling because seiko actually be against the plan from the start manipulate by the lustful but illprepared toyoji and her reaction to gisaburos reappearance be stagger to her take the one that come close to poetry gisaburos ghost paleblue face and mostly silent chill stare motion for seiko to get on the rickshaw she do reluctantly and he push her around on a road she doesnt know in the wee hour before dawn surround by smoke most japanese ghost story wish to heaven they could get this harrowingly atmospheric.while it start to veer into hysteric towards the end theres so much here that director oshima get right in make this a distinctive work after hit it huge in the international cinema world with in the realm of the sens which ironically get ban in his own country he make something that he claim be even more daring that sense maybe he be right empire of passion have less graphic sexual content by far than it predecessor also star tatsuya fuji a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range but it daring lie in craft a world of dread you can believe in ghost in this story but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hell these two wouldbe lovebird will go the snoop detective or the gossiping townspeople be the least of their worry the fate of their very soul be at stake.and oshima take what in other hand could be merely juicy pulp sadly it wouldnt surprise me if an american remake be already in the work and craft shot after gorgeous shot with repetition work it way into the misenscene i.e the shot of seiko and toyoji walking on that road the camera at a dutch angle the world tilt and surround them in a grim blue hue as well a some affect movement that will stay with me long after i finish type this i.e toyoji throw the leaf by one hand into the well in slow motion or how seikos nude body be reveal after she become blind it dare lie in connect on a level of the spirit not to be confuse with the spiritual though there may be something with that as well about life and death connection to one another inextricably it a classic waiting to be discover,negative

oh my goodness i would have never think it be possible for me to see a thriller bad than domestic disturbance this soon but here it be arm with rotten plot terrible edit stilted acting and headacheinducing style sorry i have no other word for it sanctimony be the kind of movie that almost force you to reevaluate an entire genre that be this film be so bad that even the thriller i condemn a complete failure now seem a little better.now not only sanctimony be a terrible film in itself it also succeed in the difficult task of rip off good movie and do a pathetic job with it right from the main title nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce the one from see i be under the impression that something didnt smell quite right as soon a the movie start with a series of corny wannabe hip quickcuts full of gory image and bombastic color i know where that smell be come from.it turn out that two policeman or rather policeman jim renart michael parã© and policewoman dorothy smith jennifer rubin be investigate on a murder spree in vancouver a serial killer know a monkey killer what a menace chilling nickname uh for his work method have kill quite a lot of people you see this nut apparently work follow the proverb see no evil hear no evil speak no evil and cut eye ear and tongue out of his victim so far six eye six ear and three tongue in very ingenious fashion renart and smith figure out that the monkey killer be probably go to kill other three people ... well because he probably want to complete the number so suddenly the film focus on tom gerrick casper van dien a young successful goodlooking businessman with a dreadful temper and thats where the ripoff of american psycho kick in.so we follow the life of the two police officer and the young psychopath none of which be interest in the least until they finally meet along the way to that a disco where renart barely miss gerrick unintentionally offer u one of the funny scene in recent memory renart go in the back of the disco club because ... well just because the script tell u it a suspect place then with one single punch in the stomach renard get rid of a big guard who block the path and the guard be never hear of again do this scene strike anyone else a completely unrealistic anyway after another murder gerrick turn in a a witness but smith and especially renart immediately suspect he might be the killer in typical basic instinct fashion smith get some date with the young businessman under the assumption that she might discover his true identity.i wont spoil the end but it be quite simply an embarrassment there be contradiction some plot hole issue that never get resolve and especially there be one last scene where a utal mass murder suppose to be shock and sad come off a such laughably overdone and nonsensical that i frankly cant imagine how anyone could not laugh at it.at minute sanctimony be really push it you never care about one single character because they be all so flat not to mention bore that you know exactly who be who the first time you meet them you be never pull into the story because the scene be connect through weak plot device when not downright unnecessary and out of place the act range from average van dien to downright atrocious rubin and most of the support cast the music be abysmal generic techno and the photography be one of the bad i have ever see of course like every fiasco of the genre we be provide with a little bit of gratuitous nudity./,negative
the man with a golden arm be one of a trio of great film around that same time that dealt with drug addiction the other two be monkey on my back and a hatful of rain but i think of the three this one be the best.maybe if otto preminger have shoot the thing in the real chicago instead of those obvious studio set the film might have be good yet who know maybe preminger couldnt get enough money to pay for the location it the only flaw i find in the film.frank sinatra be a heroin addict card dealer who be bust for cover for his bos robert strauss when the game be raid he take the cure while in jail and want a new life a a jazz drummer but a whole lot of people be conspire against him.first bob strauss who want him back deal especially because a couple of heavyweight gambler be in town he use a few underhanded method to get sinatras service back secondly darren mcgavin be the local dope dealer who want sinatra good and hook a a customer again and finally eleanor parker his cling wife who work a con game to beat all just to keep him around.frank sinatra get a nomination for best actor for this film but lose to ernest borgnine in marty sinatra might have win for this one if he hadnt win for from here to eternity in the support actor category a few year back and that marty be such an acclaimed film in that year his scene go through withdrawal lock up in kim novaks apartment will leave you shaken.eleanor parker do not get enough credit for her role shes really something a the crazy scheme wife who want sinatra tie to her no matter what the cost if she have not be nominate that same year for interrupted melody she might have be nominate for this mark the high point of her career darren mcgavin get his first real notice a the very serpentine drug peddler his performance be guarantee to make your flesh crawl.elmer bernstein contribute a great jazz score to accentuate the general dinginess of the bleak chicago neighborhood the character live in not a place youd want to ing up your family,positive

this be a bad film a it central message be very muddled and the plot seem like it be the result of merge several disparate script a a result it often make absolutely no sense at all and certainly be not a film miss dunne or mr. huston should have be proud of make however the film be worth watch if you be a fan of precode film because it feature an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly say that nice girl do put outeven if they arent marry and even if their partner be the film begin with miss dunne a a social worker assist troop head to europe for wwi in the process she meet a scalawag bruce cabot who eventually convince her to sleep with him she become pregnant and he then go on to the next unsuspecting woman however miss dunne do not want him back a she realize he not worth it but later her baby die at child birth while all these very controversial plot element be use they be always allude toalmost like they want the adult in the audience to know but hop that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way kid in the audience will be clueless after all film be not rat and kid might attend any film at this time .surprisingly this entire plot involve a stillborn baby and cabot end about of the way through the film and be never mention again or allude to it be a if they film part of a movie and abandon ittacking it on to still another film in this second phase of the film miss dunne unexpectedly begin work at a womens prison though we actually never really get to see her do anything there what we do see be countless horrible scene of severe abuse and torture that be probably design to titillate and a a result of all this violence miss dunne go on a crusade to clean up the prison and become a reformer and famous writer.but then out of the blue another type of film emerges and the woman prison reform business go by the wayside dunne meet a judge walter huston who be married but he desperately want her now throughout the film dunne be portray a a very good girleven though she do have unmarried sex with cabot she be more or less trick into it but now single irene who be a tireless reformer and good lady begin sleep with a married man he tell her that he and his wife be estrange and be marry in name only but she never think to investigate if this be true and with his assurance off fly her clothes and they be in the baby making business but while shes pregnant with his love child he indict for be a crooked judge he assure her hes innocent but he convict and it sure sound like he a scoundrelusing inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune then in the final moment of the film miss dunne try in vain to get him free and vow to wait with the child until huston be release the film then ends.so we basically have three separate film and a bizarre early s idea of what a nice girl should be like i gather that she should be a strongminded working girl who instantly become an idiot in her personal relationship this really undo all the positive about dunnes character and it really hard to imagine anyone like the film a strong woman right advocate might easily be offend at how weakminded and needy she be and religious people might see her a totally amoral or at least morally suspect with a decent rewrite this could have be a good film or at least interesting a a lewd and salacious film but it couldnt make up it mind what it want to be and be just another dull precode film,negative
i catch this movie on the scifi channel recently it actually turn out to be pretty decent as far a blist horror/suspense film go two guy one naive and one loud mouth a take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the bad possible luck when a maniac in a freaky makeshift tank/truck hyid decide to play catandmouse with them thing be far complicate when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker what make this film unique be that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie unlike so many others the two guy be likable enough and there be some good chase/suspense scene nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror/slasher buff definitely worth check out,neutral
very mild spoiler a basic plot outline no real detail if you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectation i saw this film at a free screen a few day ago in maryland and the only reason i agree to go ... be because it be free i expect a few chuckle but a i have never be a huge fan of tenacious d not much more then that.the first ten minute of the film be hilarious a we be give a look at jack black humble christian origin in a midwest american town the film then take u year into the future to the first meeting between jb and kyle gas the second half of tenacious d. we see the formation of the band and the genesis of it name finally a the title suggest the second half of the film detail their quest to obtain the fabled pick of destiny again the beginning of the film be laugh out loud funny and most of the movie at least keep a smile on my face that say there be time it felt a bit long it only minute but it still felt like it should have be a bit short the story be every bit as absurd a it sound and this be not a film you see if you want a real plot which be fine except it mean that many of the joke be very hit or miss ... and when they miss they miss bad same thing with the song it be a musical but many of the song lose their appeal after the first minute or so ... then keep go anyway.i will say that the rrating really save this movie from bomb the d humor simply couldnt work without cuss sex and drug reference but unless youre a real fan of the band or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy i would recommend you save yourself some money and rent pick will make you giggle a bit ... but be it worth buck i dont think so i be tempt to rate it a but since i do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify see it in theatres a seem more appropriate just be sure it your style,positive
i shall begin with a disclaimer this movie be not recommend for anyone who lack interest or have never play ff the game before watch the movie rely on the audience knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot element and it do so very subtly do your homework before watch this wonderful piece of cg film and i promise itll be that much better.with that in mind this film have some of the most spectacular cg sequence i have ever witness the whole experience felt like an extra long fmv sequence from the game on steroid yeah the attention to detail in each scene especially in the heavy action orient one be so impeccable it leave me with a sense of awe.i believe the soundtrack be simplify so a to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music again for those who be familiar with the ff story and background the music should not surprise anyone although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhance the animation .once again i myself have only play through ff once thoroughly enjoy this piece of art from square enix and that be the feel in most scene choreograph and organize like a dance.in short if you enjoy the music or the game final fantasy this film will blow you out of the water if youre in the unfortunate majority who have not experience the goodness know a ff on playstation or pc do so before watch the movie will allow for an exponentially great experience.finally i just want to make a note of the quality in animate this film character move with fluidity each scene background come to life and tell it own story for those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot i urge you to reexamine the animation facial reaction subtle clue that ing about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery.square enix and the great tetsuya nomura have set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling advent child have usher in a new era for cg animation allow the subtlety that lie in each character to speak volume in and of themselves.thanks square enix the wait be well worth it,positive

this film be quite simply one of the bad film ever make and be a damn indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hack at work today not only do the film get mainstream distribution it also feature a good cast of british actor so what go wrong i dont know and simply i dont care enough to engage with the debate because the film be so terrible it deserve no thought at all be warn and stay the hell away from this rubbish but apparently i need to write ten line of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot a nob of a man be setup by his evil friend and coworker out of his father company and thus lead to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accent and stupid very stupid plot twists/devices i should have ask for my money back but be perhaps still in shock from the experience if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspect or the godfather what about lock stock .... thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film .....,negative

this movie be a riot i can not remember the last time i have such a great time at the movie ive see a few good comedy in my time and usually they be pretty funny but this one be wall to wall great line i think best in show be the last movie that i laugh so hard and so much in the movie be nonstop until the end when they do the minute of sentimental plot clean up other than that it a constant barrage of one liner and goofy situation id like to see it again before it leave the theater because this be like the zucker movie where you dont get all the joke the first time around you have to see it two or three time to get it all in.as far a the actual film go it could have use a good edit it choppy at time but we have to be forgive for that all the character be great it not like an adam sandler movie where he try to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and be the butt of the joke i think i will remember all the main character for year to come because they be all so likable no victim in this movie also thank god they get a year old actress to play his girlfriend catherine keener play her and she be a sweetheart in this film you just wish that woman like her really existed shes not a like some of the other leading lady but somehow her smile be warm than julia robert overdo overbite.if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it i assure you the trailer do not do it justice they do not give away all the good joke just some of the mediocre ones.oh and one more thing i hope critic put this on their top ten list many of them complain that comedy dont get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they dont put it on their list this mean you ebert,positive

it rare that i feel a need to write a review on this site but this film be very deserving because of how poorly it be create and how bias it product was.i felt a distinct attempt on the part of the filmmaker to display the palestinian family a boorish and untrustworthy we hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression yet the film be shot and arrange in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population be the jewish israeli population we see no evidence that parallel the position of the palestinian teenager we only hear from other palestinian in prison i understand restriction be in place but the political nature of the restriction be design to prevent peace.i come out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim be selfish in her mourning and completely close mind due to her side of the fence so to speak she continue to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber parent and her angry and closedminded word cause the final meeting to spiral out of control it be more realistic in my mind to see the israeli mindset to be a root of the problem ignore plea for understanding and freedom ignore request for acknowledgment for the process by which the jewish population acquire the land.i have give this a two because of these selfish weakness of the mother which normally would be admirable in a documentary however in the light of the lack of impartiality it all seem exploitative also for the poor edits lack of background in the actual instance and finally the lack of proper representation of the palestinian side ultimately it be a poor documentary and a poor film i acknowledge this be partially the result of the political situation but be oblige to note the flaw in direction regardless of the heartwrenching and sad subject matter,negative

such a joyous world have be create for u in pixars a bug life be immerse in a universe which could only be document this enjoyably on film but more precisely a universe which could only be document through the world of animation for those who have forget what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer â– when it in the right hand that be â– a bugs life be a warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equallywarm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only highcalie film productions.it be only pixars second animate feature the subgroup of disney make their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three year prior in with their landmark movie toy story it be a movie which defy convention reinvent and eathed new life into animation and define a whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draw a creep sense of cynicism in u all prior to see the film.after all it a film about ant well all walk of the insect and bug world be cover in a bugs life but it be the ant which be the focal point in this film a human be the focal point in drama romance and so on how can such an insignificant specie of animal such a an ant act a the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story a bunch of toybox item be able to become the grand most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated hero and villain ever concoct the guy at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bug into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin youll probably ever encounter.not only be they all entirely amiable and likable â– there isnt an unpleasant character in sight even the villain be rivet character â– but theyre colourful theyre eclectic and theyre idiosyncratic and the array of character be also gargantuan for lack of a good term only add the rich layer of distinctiveness already plaster onto a bugs life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name be flik david foley and his character be rather generic to say the least out of the thousand of faithful and obedient worker ant reside on the lush beautiful ant island he be the one consider the black sheep of the clan a see in the opening moment of the movie when he inadvertently destroy the season harvest with his antics.the problem arise in the fact that the ant harvest be for a bunch of greedy grasshopper lead by hopper kevin spacey who be eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ant when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering be go they go insane for lack of a good term hopper offer a proposition to save the ant from total extinction at his pack hand however it a negotiation which be simply impossible to fulfil the cog and clockwork in fliks mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offer to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warrior who can come to the colony rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers.if you think about it a bugs life bear some heavy resemblance to the plot line of akira kurosawa classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which a village of hapless but goodhearted folk be threaten by malevolent and wicked enemy â– one lone villagedweller go in search for help in the big city find it and return to the colony to drive off evil in a bugs life the help come in the form of

first let me just comment on what i like about the movie the special effect be fantastic and very rarely do i feel like i be watch a video game there that be the last nice thing i have to say about this film in fact i would just like everyone read this to take note that i cant even put into word how hard it be for me to write this review without swear i have innumerable complaint about the film but four major complaint jump to mind my first major complaint have to do with the incredible cheesiness of the plot twist if you can call it that since most people probably saw it come a mile away where loiss yearold son turn out to be the superpowered child of superman when the cry superchild throw a piano at lexs henchman to save his mother i almost get up and leave the theater singer could have make a much good superman movie without resort to cheap gimmick like a seemingly fragile but latently superpowered illegitimate child it be day since i saw the movie and i still want to vomit my next major complaint have to do with the fact that superman lift a continent make out of kryptonite up into out space it doesnt take comic book guy from the simpson to point out whats wrong with that i dont know how many comic book brian singer have read but when superman be expose to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely have the strength to stay on his foot whoever have the idea to have him fly a large island make out of his great weakness into space have no business be associate with any supermanrelated project ever again the concept be as ridiculous a make a dracula movie where the title character have a stake through his heart and still manage to fly a spaceship make out of garlic into the sun why not just have superman eat kryptonite he can eat it and then ush his teeth with it and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajama thats not any more absurd then have him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burn up in reentry or splatter all over central park when he hit the ground my third major complaint have to do with the fact that singer slap moviegoer across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie i have to take issue with his characterization of superman a the only son of a godlike jorel send to earth to be a savior jorel wasnt allwise he be just a scientist and he didnt send his son to earth to be a savior he throw him in a rocket and hurriedly fire it into space because his planet be about to explode ill buy the christ allegory if brian singer can show me the part in the bible where god send christ to earth because heaven be about to explode and then radioactive piece of heaven become christ primary weakness furthermore the crucifixion scene where luthor stab superman in the side with a kryptonite spear just make me want to slam my face into a ick until im too aindead to notice the azenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be taint the man of steel for the foreseeable future they might as well rename this movie superman return the passion of the christ.and speaking of luthor my last major complaint have to do with singer depiction of lex luthor lex luthor be a shrewd coldhearted business tycoon who be more apt to run for president which he do in the comic than try to destroy the world the man want money and power he want to be in charge not wreck everything yet the luthor we see superman return as well a all the previous superman movie be a wacky theatrical dunce who come up with zany scheme to destroy the world if singer have the slight loyalty to the character instead of the quite awful previous superman movie this film might not be such an unbearable travesty maybe singer next project can be a batman movie where he focus on the interpretation of batman from s tv show zam whap pow to summarize i dont know what i hate more the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be give it good review everyone be entitle to their opinion but if you dont hate this movie then your opinion be wrong i sincerely encourage anyone who read this not to see this movie if you havent already dont see it dont buy it when it come out on dvd dont rent it ... basically dont contribute any money towards it in any way this movie do not deserve to make any money in fact i think that for every person that see this movie bryan singer should be fin billion dollar if youre a superman fan and you really want to see this movie just bend over and have someone kick you in the ball and youll get the same experience without have to waste hour of your time,positive
this be one of the best tv production of a musical ever i have hear the merman cast album the angela lansbury album i have see tyne daly live and ive see the rosalind russell movie countless time i think bette be if not the best then tie with the best she capture not just the avura but also the pathos of mama rise i be never a natalie wood fan so i really enjoy cynthia gibb in what be arguably her best role everything from the costume to the set to the support performance be wonderful the three stripper lead by the alwaysdependable christine ebersole be hard to top there be suppose to be a tv production of mame a few year back with cher but i think bette would be the best bet pun intend for auntie mame,positive
i be sorry to say that this film be indeed bad it remind me of a cgrade porn movie with one major difference no porn.the story and dialogue need a complete overhaul maybe then the bad act would not have be a noticeable at the very least the pacing should have be pick up.while i accept that this have a low budget and the director do a good job visually give what little resource he have he should have spend more time on the story or good yet get someone else to write it many of the action scene be just pointless.it be a complete waste of my time,negative
be it a perfect movie no it be a weird adaptation from a scifi book and it feature vampire from space naked beauty and the british army efficiency.when i first saw this movie i be rather young and all i can remember be the feeling of awe for the movie and mathilda may actually if it werent for this gorgeous lady be naked the whole movie i probably wouldnt have rat it so high but give her sheer magnificence i be now actually consider vote it up lucky for me i get remind of the movie and watch it again now imagine raider of the lose ark or poltergeist special effect splatter unto a rather decent scifi story but with completely over the top performance i still enjoy the movie tremendously as well a mathilda may but it be a mixture of nostalgia compare with the crap movie they make today and actually want more when it ended.bottom line if you be a scifi fan you be not allow to miss this movie oh and do i mention mathilda may be young beautiful and naked,positive
overall i be rather impressed with the pilot the initial first fifteen minute be worry a it do feel the creator be try to create a science fiction version of the o.c but this fear be rectify when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show step into theme and situation that i very rarely see television tackle.bsg dealt with theme such a monotheism existentialism reality death and terrorism but they be primarily subtext there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose here on the other hand these subject be the focus of the show and i personally find myself evoke such work a ghost in the shell and the matrix a reference point while watch and be surprise by how well the theme be be discuss i think if you be a fan of the two i just mention or other films/television show which deal with the subject i reference i think you will find at least something here.in term of a start point to explain how the situation we know in bsg come about i believe they handle it in a very interesting way i especially like how they explain where the cylons belief in one god come from and the creation of caprica have just enough advanced and contemporary technology throw in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to u a viewers.the only real weak point i notice be the relationship between the greystone parent and the actress who play lacy rand while i like eric stoltz and paula malcomson individually together their scene seem to lack chemistry at this point it could simply be down to develop their character but this be something i think needs work i also find magda apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role this again could be down to experience and time need to develop but throughout the episode her acting appear force and not completely confident.based on the pilot i greatly look forward to see where caprica go in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that bsg once do,negative
im the type of guy who love hood movie from new jack city to baby boy to killa season from the b grade to the hollywood but this movie be something different i be no hater and this movie be kinda enjoyable but some bit be just weird well the act wasnt to good compare to silkk the shocker performance in hot boyz quite good and icet in new jack and svu great the scene where corrupt icet kill the wan na be jamaican dude he say something and light himself on fire burn both icet and the other dude this kill the jamaican however icet be unharmed very similar to ice other movie urban menace which star both of these actor be snoops character be supernatural however after this there be nothing suggest that corrupt be like a demon when mj silkk get stab at first he struggle but after that he fight normally and be stab in the thighwith out blood and when mj confess kill a cop cos the cop be beat up his friend benny be weird benny isnt introduce in this movie and the scene isnt in the film it do hold weight to the fact why corrupt want to kill mj but be still make u scratch your head wen jody write a letter to miss jones character explain what happen to them afterwords doesnt mention what happen other main character mj and lisa the film do show the horror and poverty of the ghettowhich plague the life of latino and black word widewas a good part of the film even though the clip of the project be reused thousand of time and the scene where mile kill the latino other by crash his bike at full speed not wear a helmet and run into my latino others car would of kill him the movie be similar to the film urban menace and half the actor be in both of these movie as well a the production team it be ok tho but me be from poverty i love hood film however if u dont love em like i do dont watch it only thing save me from walk out be it remind me of the first movie i make which be make with dollar and my love of the genre.nathaniel purez,negative
i be a huge fan of the farcry game huge fan it still hold a place in my top game list of all time the story line be new fresh ... a truly illiant foundation to base a movie on ... or so i thought ... farcry the movie be no less than another director attempt at cash in on a successful game franchise see doom the movie and many more ... .the video game begin a the player jack carver awakes in a sea side cave after be shoot off his boat by an rpg from an unknown soldier jack then find a communication device where harlan doyle guide him across island shipwreck jungle installation and volcano to find his lady friend valerie constantine all the wile battling mutate super soldier and genetically enhance animals.the movie play out very very differently theres a needless min of the movie of backstory before we even get to the boat blow up scene jack then walk onto the beach kill some goon then drive off ... nothing like the game ... there be no communicator with doyle on the other end ... the modified soldier look like albino with singlet on ... and there be no mutate monkeylike creature jump out of the bush a part of the farcry game i enjoy allot ... there be no sun fill beach scene no aircraft carrier no communication station on huge cliff little reference to any ingame content characters/items/vehicles in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all the climactic volcano scene from the game be replace with an old industrial building there an end scene ... where everyone except krieger live happily ever after ... what the i recommend avoid this movie at all cost if you be a gamer you will hate this movie will all your soul it be a movie clearly intend for male so girls stay away ... so if your a male year of age have never play farcry and be not disgust by director attempt at port books/games to the cinema ... then this be for you ...,positive

you can not deny that we have an affinity for speed thats why movie like fast and the furious dhoom rempit get make to play to the satisfaction of audience especially local one we live on a tiny island and i can not fathom why for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system most of u want to get into debt by own a set of wheel which come with tax when they reach our shore and the myriad of tax and bill to pay when operate one not only that the high end sport car be once quip by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear l they reach the sea.and these movie be relatively easy to make hot wheel and hot chick always go down well together in target the required demographic for once those plunge neckline expose uncanny buxom and short skirt accentuate legs two meter long cant compete with the attention give to those beautiful curve that exotic car posse in movie such a these of course there be amongst u ahem those that go for the sexist portrayal of woman a mere sexual object otherwise explain why motor show come with truckloads of model and movie such a these can not do without a leggy model in a frame however they dont warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sigh whenever the four wheeler come on screen even when they do exactly nothing and have their gear into park the guy sit beside me i swear he wet his pant every time his dream car s appear and cream his pant even more when he hear those growl engine moans.so there we have it the fan boy who turn up in drove just to watch which of the late cool car get feature in the movie with the fast and the furious franchise the japanese model like the evos and the skyline take centerstage as do the gt here the ford gt take on an incredibly droolworthy facade modification that even im impressed alongside the late model like the ferrari enzos porshe carerra gts koenigsegg ccxs and every car out there that have wing for door but seriously my heart go out to the car each time theyre mercilessly wreck just for entertainment i mean this be perfectly fine high performance model that be at the apex of motor but yet because whoever finance the movie have million to blow they do so because they cantheres no story in redline just excuse to put together a movie full of beauty the car that be that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible and with the usual shot of pedal always the accelerator mind you tap the ake pedal be tantamount to blasphemy and earn you no respect steer wheel gear shift always shift up and not down all these while have the actor make pretend that theyre the baddest ass with an engine snarling and give each other dirty look not a very tall order for an actor and thats why we get the most woeful performance ever with line that seem to be write by elementary schoolkids.the heroine yes it make a statement that girl can drive natasha a very plasticky look nadia bjorlin be one of those million dollar find a girl with model look who dont mind get down on four and immerse in oil who have race pedigree within her and performs with a rock band sing song with lyric that be just plain laughable every line have to do with car and when sing about love just have to string those innuendo like shift gear shafts luicants and go for ride introduce against her wish to illegal racing by a gangsta call infamous eddie griffin she get draw into family squabble involve a leo dicaprio lookalike iraq war veteran and some sleazy lecherous look rich uncle everything else well like i say just serve a an excuse for the movie to go from race to race.and it almost always the same a there very limit to what you can do to heighten tension between race car especially when you know the race be rig for narrative reason and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line while fast and furious have quite charismatic actor and i will put my head on the chop block by name paul walker sun kang and of course the star it create vin diesel redline have none just pretty face with lot of air unfortunately it look like a tv movie in it treatment from the get go with a very insipid opening sequence where it one man one car and a minute race against time to get to vegas.if not for the car then this movie seriously be a piece of junk with bad act bad line and bad action strictly for the car fan or those who like their movie with countless of bevy beauty who pimp their body without any speaking line,positive

i just get this video use and i be watch it last night the acting start out extremely bad heyheytwister but get very good soon after ward the tornado look extremely fake and many of the cgi effect be very dodgy but the scene with the house crack apart and the content inside be blow around and suck out be extremely well do and just about on par with movie like twister the scene of devastation be also extremely well do too the story be very well write and it refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old disaster formula movie of this genre seem to have be stick in for years.while this movie have a very weird mix of fx and act quality this merit an a in my book,negative
this film be really vile it play on the urban paranoia of the s/s and put it into a school context im not say that urban crime wasnt a problem for a lot of people or that school werent/arent problem area but this vile piece of exploitation take the biscuit violence be beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it not a case of social issue but a white uppermiddle class student use it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol and of course he know how to play the system do that sound familiar yes this turd be pure violent exploitation a really nasty piece of work it disturb utality dress up a a social comment this belong in the same category a trash like exterminator death wish and so on and so on the only remarkable thing be that michael fox be so oke at the time that he have to do stuff like this,negative

sixth escapade for freddy krueger in which he have finally manage to kill off virtually every youth in springwood now he want to oaden his horizon and spoiler need a family member in order to do it.a failure a a horror movie because it simply aint scary at all work well a a dark macae black comedy to tell you the truth freddy krueger have now be strip of all of his ability to chill this viewer too many wisecrack thats for sure the actor arent interest save robert englund a always and an obviously slum yaphet kotto and there be simply far too many visual effect the finale be ok but doesnt provide a many spark a i think one might hope.in add a new twist to the familiar dream killer story it provide englund the opportunity to do more nonmakeup scene than ever before.there be cameos worth note a joint cameo by thencouple roseanne and tom arnold that be devoid of entertainment value an appropriate appearance by veteran shockrocker alice cooper and a funny cameo by johnny depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he have become.film debut of breckin meyer who play spencer.one of the best thing about it be the replaying of key scene from early entry during the closing credits./,positive

a response to previous comment make by resident of the region where this motion picture be lensed one person suggest that the closing and destruction of the ocean view amusement park lead to a downturn in the surround neighborhood this be simply not true prior to the construction of interstate which bypass the ocean view area the primary route for traffic go through the heart of ocean view once the interstate be complete ocean view rapidly become a ghost town with business close up and an increase in crime this lead to a huge reduction in revenue for the park which also face new competition from nearby busch garden in williamsburg meanwhile in the past few year the city of norfolk have do a remarkable job of foster redevelopment so that the area have become a soughtafter location for construction of highend housing.it have also be say that the destruction footage of the roller coaster be use in the film rollercoaster this be also untrue footage be shoot of two coaster car careen off the ride for that film but the actual explosion and collapse be exclusive to death of ocean view park.as to the film itself the storyline of a supernatural force in the water adjacent to the park be certainly silly but somewhat typical for bgrade movie of the time with the cast involve there should be no surprise that the scenery be gnaw in almost every scene by the primary actor i dont believe this film be intend to be another citizen kane i believe playboy be experiment with a new nonnude format to determine if this be an area for the company to expand into apparently not a strange force in the water cause strange event in an old amusement park probably sound good at the conference table but prove unmanageable in execution the roller coaster and the rest of the park be destine for the wreck ball anyway let come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise .for the casual movie viewer this would be a see once and forget about it film except for diana canova fan but for the thousand of people who live in the region and have fond memory of the park this movie be like a walk down memory lane for footage of the park as well a old footage of downtown norfolk the first harborfest and old dominion university even a limited release of this film on dvd would be welcome,positive

a trio of buddy sergeant all in the british army carouse awl their way across imperial india intensely loyal to each other they meet their great most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult it demented implacable guru now they must rely on the lowly servant of the regiment the water carrier gunga din to save score of the queen soldier from certain massacre.based more on the three musketeer than kipling classic poem this be a wonderful adventure epic a worthy entry in hollywood golden year of fill with suspense humor while keep the romantic interlude to the bare minimum it grip the interest of the viewer and hold it right up to the sentimental conclusion.it be practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuance of the three star cary grant victor mclaglen douglas fairbanks jr. a they be really all third of a single organism inseparable and to all intent purpose indistinguishable however this diminish nothing of the great fun in simply watch them have a glorious time it interesting to note parenthetically that mclaglen boast of a distinguished world war one military career fairbanks would have a sterling record in world war two mostly in clandestine affair earn himself no few than honorary knighthood after the conflict while grant reportedly work undercover for british intelligence keep an eye on hollywood nazi sympathizer the real acting laurel here should go to sam jaffe hearteaking in the title role he infuse the humble man with radiant dignity enormous courage make the last line of kipling poem ring true he be unforgettable.montague love be properly stalwart a the regimental major whilst eduardo ciannelli be evil incarnate a the thuggee guru the rest of the cast joan fontaine robert coote lumsden hare be effective but have little to do movie maven will recognize cecil kellaway in the tiny role of miss fontaines father.the film pick it villain well the demonic thuggee cult worshiper of the hideous bloodsoaked kali hindu goddess of destruction be the bane of indian life for century ritualistically strangle up to victim a year in the british military in cooperation with a number of princely state succeed in ultimately suppress the religion henceforth it would remain the stuff of novel nightmare,positive

i think that rotj be clearly the best out of the three star war movie i find it surprising that rotj be consider the weak installment in the trilogy by many who have vote to me it seem like rotj be the best because it have the most profound plot the most suspense surprise most emotional especially the end and definitely the most episodic movie i personally like the empire strike back a lot also but i think it be slightly less good than than rotj since it be slowermoving be not a episodic and i just do not feel as much suspense or emotion a i do with the third movie.it also seem like to me that after read these surprising review that the reason people cite for rotj be an inferior film to the other two be just plain ludicrous and be insignificant reason compare to the sheer excellence of the film a a whole i have hear many strange reason such a a because yoda die b because bobba fett die c because small ewoks defeat a band of stormtroopers d because darth vader be revealedi would like to debunk each of these reason because i believe that they miss the point completely first off who care if bobba fett die if george lucas want him to die then he want him to die dont get me wrong i be fan of bobba fett but he make a few cameo appearance and it be not lucas intention to make him a central character in the film that star war fan make him out to be his name be not even mention anywhere in the movie ... you have to go to the credit to find out bobba fetts name judge rotj because a minor character die be a bit much i think ... secondly many fan do not like yoda die sure it be a momentous period in the movie i be not happy to see him die either but it make the movie more realistic all the good guy cant stay alive in a realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guy live and all the bad guy die this movie would have be tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not like yodas death .. well nobody complain when darth vader strike down obi wan kenobi in a new hope many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy why be obi wan death okay but yodas not ... hmmmmmmmmmmmm .... another reason i just can not believe be even state be because people find cute ewoks overpower stormtroopers to be impossible that be utterly ridiculous i can not believe this one first off the ewoks be in their native planet endor so they be cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactic the ewoks use in defeat the stormtroopers be through excellent use of their home field advantage since you live in the forest all your life i hope you would have learn to use it to your advantage they have swing vine rope log set up to trip those walker and other trap the stormtroopers be highly disadvantage because they be outnumber and not aware of the advantage of the forest the only thing they have be their blaster to add it be not like the ewoks be battle the stormtroopers themselves they be heavily assist by the band of rebel in that conquest i think that if the stormtroopers be to have defeat a combination of the star war heros the band of rebel as well a the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have be a great upset lastly if this scene be still unbelievable to you .. how about in empire strike back or in a new hope where there be several scene of a group consist of just han solo chewbacca and the princess be shoot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blaster miss while the hero be in full view and not only that the hero of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blaster the trooper must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strike back the battle of endor be much more believable since you have two army pit each other not hero against a legion of stormtroopers dont believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our hero be escape landos base or when our hero be rescue princess leia and be shoot at somehow they miss a han solo and luke be try to exit the death star.the last reason that i care to discuss others be just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here be that people do not like darth vader be reveal well in many way that be a major part of the plot in the movie luke be try to find whether or not darth vader be his father annakin skywalker it would have be disappoint if the movie have end without luke get to see his father face because it make it complete by annakins revelation it symbolize the transition darth vader underwent from be possess by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he be annakin skywalker by remove the helmet the point be that annakin die convert to the light side again and that be what the meaning of the helmet removal scene be about in fact thats be what i would have do in that scene too if i be luke father ... isnt that what you would have do if you want to see your son with your own eye before you die and not in a mechanized helmet on another note i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people be that the sequel must be bad even if it be well that precede movie be another reason that rotj do not get a many accolade a it deserve i never go into a film with that deception in mind i always try to go into a film with the attitude that well it might be good or bad that the original .. but i can not know for sure .. let see that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into think that a clearly superior film be not as good a it really was.i be not sure who criticize these movie but i have ask many college student and adult about which be their favorite star war movie and they all tell me except for one person that say that a new hope be their favorite that it be rotj i believe that the result on these poll be appal and quite misleading.bottom line the return of the jedi be the best of the trilogy this movie be the only one of the three that keep me rivet all throughout it minute there be not a moment of boredom because each scene be either suspenseful excite surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj be good than the one in the empire strike back any day finally i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fan start look for nitpicky insignificant detail or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such a this movie stink because luke be not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffer unfortunately,positive
crossfire remain one of the best hollywood message movie because unlike the admirably intentioned gentleman agreement which it beat to theatre by a few month it choose to send it message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outrage star constantly say it because im jewish isnt it it much easy to get the message that hate be like a loaded gun across when the dead body be actual rather than metaphorical somewhat shamefully the ief featurette on the warner dvd doesnt mention that novelist richard brook disown the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an antisemitic one but it interesting to note that while the victim be kill primarily because he be jewish there little doubt in sam levenes performance that the character be in fact also gay â– not a mincing caricature but theres definitely a two lose soul aspect to his scene with george cooper confuse soldier there not much of a mystery to who the murderer be even though the killing be carry out in classic noir shadow the body language of the killer be instantly recognisable but then the film have it character drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point the tension come from prove it and save the fall guy.theres an element of ealing film to the gang of soldier team together to get their buddy out of a fix you could almost see that aspect a a blueprint for hue and cry but the atmosphere be pure rko noir set over one long swelter night the film have a great look fill with deep dark black and shadow bear a much out of economy a style it cut back on lighting time and allow director edward dmytryk more time to work with the actor and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script a laidback but quietly charismatic robert mitchum robert young maigretlike detective gloria grahame tramp and the perpetually creepy paul kelly a her compulsive liar admirer a guy who try on story the way other people try on tie but the lasting impression be of robert ryans excellent performance a a guy who could do with a good leave alone a he do his best to help the wrongly accuse man all the way to death row a big surprise hit in a a reward dmytryk and producer adrian scott find themselves investigate by the huac which itself have a notable tendency to target jew so much for crusadingâ…,negative
this movie basically be a very well make production and give a good impression of a war situation and it effect on those involve it always interesting to see the story from the other side for a change this movie concentrate on a group of german soldier who after fight in the north africa campaign be send to stalingrad russia where one of the most notorious and bloody battle of ww ii be be fought.its interest to see the other side of this battle since we mainly just always see the german simply a the villain in this movie those villain be give an humane face and voice and it sort of make you realize that the only true enemy in war be war itself and not necessarily those who youre fight against at first it kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the german be the evil villain but of course you get accustom to it quickly and you soon adapt the german a the main character of the movie and you even start to care and be interested in them.the way this story be tell isnt however the best it hard to keep track of the story at time a it jump from the one sequence and location to the other the movie isnt always logic in it storytelling and feature a bit too many sequence that remain too vague it also be most of the time pretty hard to keep the character apart and see who be who it doesnt always make this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand there be plenty enough sequence and moment present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one just not the most coherent one around in that regard hollywood movie be always good than european movies.the production value be high and feature some good look set and location though the movie wasnt even shoot in russia itself it help to create a good war time situation atmosphere.the character be mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic but i dont know for some reason formulaic character always work out fine in war movie and strenghtens the drama and realism it also help that theyre be play by well cast actor all of the actor arent the best known actor around thomas kretschmann be also at the time still a fairly unknown actor but each of them fit their role well and give it character an unique face and personality.all in all not the best or most consistent ww ii drama around but definitely worth a look due to it original approach of the german side of the battle of stalingrad and it good production values./,positive
so i rent this from netflix because somebody give me roger eberts book i hat hat hat this movie and he give this one a rare zerostar rating in the book and say at the end of his original review mad dog time should be cut up to provide free ukulele pick for the poor so i figure from ebert say that i would see if it be really as bad a he say it be i know most society say not to listen to critic and to judge for yourself but i could not express how much i hat this piece of junk like ebert do and never since eberts review of rob reiners north where he say he hat that movie ten time have i ever hear such a illiant hatred movie review here we have richard dreyfus a a gangster which i dont think it would be terrible to see dreyfuss a a gangster if the screenplay for this movie be write well but above all the other thing that be awful about this movie i can certainly tell you the script be not write well at all while the movie start off with jeff goldblum say that he enjoy watch dreyfusss girlfriend while dreyfus be at a criminal hospital the movie start off with some decent dialog after the opening credit but after that first or minute the other minute just consists of dumb character talk pointless garbage for second then someone get shot then there be a whole bunch of joke about dreyfus be mentally ill. haha not funny then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parody frank sinatra my way sang by gaiel byrne apparently to insult dreyfus of course because the screenplay be write on the level of a sixth grader dreyfus shoot byrne over five time and byrne just will not die be we a the audience suppose to even care or find that mildly funny i can certainly tell you i do not care or find that funny not only be i disappoint in dreyfus who i admire much a an actor for produce and star in this tripe but i be also extremely disappointed in jeff goldblum because this be release the same year that independence day be the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful film in history do goldblum feel that independence day would be a flop and then just take the next role that be offer to him to make some money if independence day be a bomb what do an oscar winner and the star of two of the big money make film in history find remotely enjoyable about this the opening sequence of mad dog time say that the movie be set on another planet i only wish now that i have waste minute watch this trash that it would have stay and open in theater on the planet where it supposedly take place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of minute out of my life that i will never get back ebert say the movie should have be cut up be not good enough i be afraid every copy of mad dog time should have gasoline pour all over it and be light on fire i have yet to top a bad movie i have ever see because this one have win it honor a the bad movie ever,negative

rant start i didnt want to believe them at first but i guess this be what people be talk about when they say south korean cinema have peak and may even be go downhill after the surprisingly fun and move monster movie gwoemul aka the host of which actually succeed in make a sharp satire out of a bmovie genre successive korean blockbuster have become more and more generic even though their budget mainly spend on special effect have become more and more fantastic do south korean moviemakers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill which their industry have build up since the eakout film shiri/swiri by make a whole series of big budget mediocre movie like mainland china do rant end the only reason i can fathom for make this movie be to dupe the investor into finance the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a korean/ east asianstyled dragon i have see to date for the final scene now if they have introduce that dragon at the beginning and give it more personality and purpose like in the dragonheart the movie might have have a few more redeeming quality other than have lot of digitally animate dragon remember dungeon dragon in hasnt anyone learnt that the trick be not how much special effect you use but how well you use it i hope there be more and good korean legend they can use because they have just kill a lot of international interest in korean dragon legends with the way they film this one.in short i agree with all the negative review go before and wonder how korean felt about have their folk anthem arirang be play at the very end a a creature feature i would have give it at least star out of if the special effect or action sequence have be worth it but ive see many video game with good camera work and script just less dragon,positive
a a native chinese i can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a good world i say well world because it be a lie that chinese people have be indoctrinate for thousand year i guess most western audience may dont know qin shihuang mean the first emperor the king in this film be the most notorious tyrant in ancient china the tianxia chinese word be speak by the king mean the land and the people speak from his mouth be totally lie from then on one after another all the king in ancient china speak the same thing but very few of them do a what they said.another fact be qin shihuangs empire only last about twenty year before it be destroy by people.well i do like the beautiful scene of this movie but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant,negative

i dont normally write review but this film be special i couldnt turn it off i dont believe ive ever see a bad movie but there i sit watch it be like a horrible car wreck with blood flow all over the highway it be disgust but i couldnt turn away where do i start the movie seem to think it a sport thriller but it so utterly ridiculous it can only be a comedy but it not funny not even in a dumb/silly way it like watch your cousin try to act out a skit on family gettogethers it painful to watch but at least it only for a minute or two second string go on for over an hour whoever be involve with make this movie should not work again the write directing acting and everything be just terrible the problem be i cant describe how bad it be you just have to see it and im sure this will never be show again so unless you saw it youre out of luck i mean it be almost worth see just for the fact that it give me some appreciation for every other bad film ive see over my lifetime and for every film i see in the future that i cant stand i will think to myself well at least it wasnt bad a the second string,negative
few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki be one of the few to hold this ability. no too many be focus on john lassiters amaze ability to steal other movie plot turn them into pretty puppet show and then be laud a a genius but i digress miyazaki have give u film after film that deal with important mature issue usually ecologically theme and have an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that be animate could thoroughly enjoy if give the chance still miyazaki almost never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movie children.that say i be at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability where else be you go to have a film where a three year old my nephew link will sit still throughout the move enthral a year old my niece amber love it all her own and able to appreciate the star power of frankie jonas and noah cyrus a year old my nephew aaron who review be of course it be good everything miyazakisan do be good a year old animation fan ought to tear by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation er that would be me and a year old woman my mother able to connect with the mother character and im bet the old chara too and love the cuteness of the child characters.and that be what i respect most about miyazakisan he seem to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker on the surface ponyo could be see a a simple story about a little fishgirl who get a taste of the human world and want to join it and the friend she make there a little boy name soske somewhat like the little mermaid but there be an entire different level at play here true to form miyazaki populate his film with intensely strong female character ponyos mother soskes mother the old lady in a nursing home be all genuine character with mind of their own and extremely strong willed.but the girl who take the cake be ponyo herself once she decide that she like the human world she simply use her own will to achieve her dream her father be try to keep her innocent and keep her a magical fish but young ponyo know what she want and become human out of simply her own determination once human she team up with her friend soske whom she love very much although maybe not as much a ham soske be ask to be the man of the house at age five when his mother lisa decide she have to help the people at the rest home where she work during a typhoon that have be inadvertently cause by ponyo on her quest to become human frankie jonas yes he relate to the jonas others can we just get past that please give perhaps the best performance in the film a young soske which be good since he have the most line his character be also strong will but also very respectful and friendly characteristic youre not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacific.in the end ponyos father fujimoto must cope with his daughter decision and his estranges wifes wish to allow her to be human he hop that ponyo and soske will remember him fondly and once again miyazaki refuse to allow a character to become the stereotypical bad guy although miyazaki have for some reason receive some criticism for this it be honestly what make his movie magical and yet relatable no one in real life be completely a bad person all human be various shade of gray and that be exactly what miyazaki do with his character and then theres the animation itself in a time when cgi would certainly have help with the copious amount of effect shot in this film especially the water miyazaki have choose to incorporate no cgi whatsoever certainly the hand drawn animation be color by digital mean but every film in this be handdrawn and i for one be extremely grateful for that the character animation be extremely fluid and there even appear to be some lipsync go on quite unusual for an anime film the background seem to be render with colored pencil and have an effect all it own on the audience this be what animation use to look like and what it should look like in the end i find ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable certainly not miyazakis best in my opinion that honor be still hold by kikis delivery service but still a star fun movie for the entire family,positive

the film begin with wheeler sneak into the apartment of his girlfriend her aunt edna may olivera person too talented for this film didnt like wheelera sentiment i can easily relate to the aunt decide to take this bland young lady aoad to get her away from wheeler they leave and wheeler invest in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promise to make him their king at about the same time woolsey be in the same small mythical kingdom and he be make king so when wheeler arrive it be up to the boy to fight it out but they refuse because they be already friendswhich greatly disappoint the people a kill and replace king be a national pastime.i be a huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywoodthe silent era through the s. i have see and review hundred if not thousand of these film and yet despite my love and appreciation for these film i have never be able to understand the appeal of wheeler and woolseythe only comedy team that might be as bad a the ritz brother despite be very successful in their short career in hollywood cut short due to the early death of robert woolsey i cant help but notice that practically every other successful team do the same basic idea but much good for example there be many element of this film reminiscent of the marx brother film duck soup yet crack nut never make me laugh and duck soup be a silly and highly enjoyable romp at time woolsey talk a bit like groucho but his joke never have punchlines that even remotely be funny in fact he just seem to prattle pointlessly his only funny quality be that he look goofysurely not enough reason to put him on film additionally wheeler have the comedic appeal of a piece of cheesea piece of cheese that sing very poorly a missed opportunity be the old vaudeville routine later popularize by abbott and costello a who on first which be do in this film but it lack any spark of wit or timing in fact soon after they start their spiel they just end the routineso prematurely that you be leave frustrated i know that who on first have be around for many year and use by many team but i really want to see wheeler and woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist.once again i have find yet another subpar film by this duo while i must admit that i like a few of their film mildly such a silly billy and the rainmakerswhich i actually give s to on imdb this one be a major endurance test to completesomething that i find happen all too often when i view the film of wheeler and woolsey where be all the humor,negative
i be really hop that this would be a funny show give all the hype and the clever preview clip and talk about hype i even hear an interview with the show creator on the bbc world today a show that be oadcast all over the world.unfortunately this show doesnt even come close to deliver all of the joke be obvious the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame and they be not give any new treatment or twist all of the character be onedimensional the acting be well mediocre im be nice it the classic cbc recipe one that always fails.if youre muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white character and if youre white youd probably be offend a little by the fact that almost all of the white character be portray a either bigoted ignorant or both not that make fun of white people be a problem most of the good comedy be root in that it only a problem when it isnt funny a in this show.canada be burst with funny people so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis so how come the producer of this show couldnt find any,positive
first of all mexican werewolf in texas be not a werewolf movie this title be bullcrap the story be actually about a chupacaa that kill all the local villager in the little town of furlough in texas i suppose the distributor rename the original title so that it would make some extra buck or something and i guess it actually work because thats the reason why i buy this piece of crap it sound so stupid anyway the movie isnt any good actually it bloody awful but i didnt expect anything else when i buy it it a low budget horror movie with a chupacaa monster if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog actor and some gore then you should check into this movie but i must warn you this movie be really baaaaaaad.this movie have some of the bad act i have ever see the actor try to hard and t it get completely ridiculous they almost never say a line in a normal way they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say it so stupid it almost look like a freakin parody it like they shoot each scene only one single time and be happy about it the bad of them all be the blond girl which be suppose to play a bimbo shes the bad of them all i have never see an actor as bad a her and ive see pteradactyl even when her boyfriend die she cant stop be a bimbo about it i hate her.some of the shot in this movie be actually quite good the one that where shot in the daytime be all pretty decent for a low budget project but most of the movie be shoot in the night when the chupacaa strike and the lighting be way too dark the gore scene be few and short but really grizzly and violent the effect be pretty hilarious really but thats the way i like it the chupacaa look pretty mess up and it easy to see that it a guy in suit.overall this movie should only be watch by extreme fan of low budget flick and it very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bore to death i recommend watch this flick with your friend and some beer,negative

the symbolic use of object form edit the position of character in the scene ... these be all use with such joyous abandon by hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he have the way the wife move from one corner of the ring to the other a the fight progress the editing when the wedding ring be place on her finger ... while these may seem a bit obvious by today standard in the silent era they speak volume about the story without a word be speak even the title have a least four meaning that i can see the box ring the wedding ring the acelet the lover buy and the love triangle at the heart of the story,positive
i find this movie to be very good in all area the acting be illiant from all character especially ms.stone and morissey tramells character just get smart and more psychologically twist by the minute the plot be interest even though this movie be more for the mind playing between the main character and how catherine continue her write with new way and twist for her novel the setting be also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie be that mysteriousthriller like masterpiece go see this film now it deserve good than what it get from the audience which be mislead by some faulty terrible review about the movie before it even start ..... you wont regret itif you go see it ...,positive
rather like paul newman and steve mcqueen with their racing car movie this have all the appearance of a jolly project for robert redford a he get to ski up hill and down dale in the alpine sunshine.the story be as light a powdered snow with redford smalltown boy david chappellet what kind of lead name be that who with his eye on the prize of olympic glory get up the nose of in no particular order his coach father and teammate woman be a mere sideshow in his insular world a evidence by a fairly distasteful pickup scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of heaven above a freethinking independent woman play by camilla sparv the skiing sequence be fine with some good stuntwork involve numerous bump and scrape on the piste but their effectiveness be dim by our subsequent familiarity with top tv coverage of ski event down to the present day plus im not convince that the winter olympics have the same mass identification with the general public a the summer game so that when redford eventually win his gold medal in the final reel i couldnt really be that excited for him one way or another.of the actor redford best profile forward doesnt need to do much and indeed doesnt while gene hackman do well with equally meagre material m sparv do well a the chief female interest well who treat redford the way hes doubtless treat every other woman in his chauvinistic way.in truth though there a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequence dont fully compensate and you dont care a fig for any of the lead character one of those film where the actor probably enjoy make it more than the viewer do watch it,positive
i would recommend this film to anyone who be search for a relaxing funfilled thoughtprovoking movie the absence of sex vulgarity and violence make for a most pleasant evening i especially enjoy the buffalo scene but thats probably because i live a short distance from there even so this film could have be produce in any city it the theme thats so important here im just grateful that manna from heaven drop down on u try it ... youll like it,positive
this be an art film that be either make in or the national film preservation foundation say and imdb say regardless of the exact date the film definitely appear to be very indicative of this general time periodwith some camerawork and pop art stylings that be pure late searly s.the film consists of three simple image that be distort use different weird camera trick these distort image be accompany by music and there be absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort this be obviously intend a almost like a form of performance art and like most performance art it interesting at first but quickly become tiresome the film to put it even more bluntly be a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who make the film their family and friend and perhaps a few people just too hip and with it to be understand by u mortal,negative

although promote a one of the most sincere turkish film with an amateur cast icecream i scream be more like a caricature of sincerity.the plot open with the dream of ali a travel icecream salesman in a western anatolia town in which he see himself become successful use the same marketing method of big icecream company he dream of play in his product tv commercial with beautiful model in bikini dance around him a his dream turn into a nightmare he wake up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife who reject to make sex with him for year with no apparent reason be it because he be not successful in his job apparently because he say he be sell well in the old day when there be no pressure from global icecream company but this be what he say we actually dont see him suffer that much he still sell good travel the neighboring village while his apprentice stay at the shop sell icecream to the people in the town ali blame big company for use sweetening and color agent while he be use real sahlep powder root of mountain orchid ali buy a motorbike with a bank loan to be a travel vendor and give ad to a local tv channel which prefers to oadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect his wife be not fond of his way of do business they always quarrel and ali threaten her that he may do very bad thing in a moment of frenzy.in a very successful day his lousy bike be steal by the misbehaving little boy of the town in search of his steal bike ali go to the police blame the big company for the theft but of course nobody take him seriously annoy by the nagging of his wife ali go to a tavern and become drunk one of his friend at his table a wannabe socialist of the town give a didactic speech and criticize globalism and with no real connection jump to the subject of global freezing ali return home and decides to kill himself with poison his wife wake up and prevents him an old neighbor take him to a night walk and advise him about life accord to him ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world face with global freezing when he return home suddenly we see that his wife understand his value treat him like a hero and praise his manhood meanwhile the thief boys get sick eat too much icecream they confess to the doctor that they steal ali bike ali forgives them and there come the happy end.although the plot may look promise in a way it the storytelling which make this film insincere and cheesy first the director doesnt show much of an effort to tell the story visually everything be base on dialog and the dialog never stop to show u that cinema be actually a visual art even alis trouble be not convincing because we dont see it we just understand it from his word the director market his film a a righteous fight of ali against big icecream company but there be nothing in the film about big company we dont see their pressure enough the film actually ridicule ali for believe that big company be behind the theft and when his motorbike be find it solve every problem ali become a happy and powerful husband not a real criticism of globalism.second the film be cheesy because of the crude humor maybe the people of that part of turkey be curse so much and make so many vulgar joke in their daily life but vulgar language and crude humor be not enough to make a film funny i may have accept it if they be both vulgar and clever but they be not clever joke at all they be just cheesy maybe im wrong maybe american people may like oriental version of american pie style humor but american pie never have any claim to be a nominee for the oscar or to have a political message if you think that you can laugh by just see a man big erection in his short and we have to endure this joke twice or an old villager woman say f k you then you may find this film funny,negative

decide to fool the child into deliver them for them they set up a race around the world where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness secretely fill with diamond at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the oppose team likeness secretely fill with the payment for the diamond to varify that they be there the winning team would then receive a dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal an interpol agent who have be hot on their heel for some time now would never suspect them because they be just kid however this seem to be redundant because on their travel the kid do not have to go through any security check and be never even question about the doll i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they have take the diamond there personally and so begin a great adventure this film be a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it it feature great animation and topnotch voice act not to mention the kickass music pardon my french p my favorite song be without a shred of doubt the girl and boy of rock and roll an amazing rock song that can not be top it also my favorite moment in the film other notable song include get lucky kind of suggestive for a kid film eh and my mother as well a wooly bully and off to see the world not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credit perform by the royal london philharmonic orchestra the scene with my mother still ings a tear to my eye in relation to the song get lucky i first didnt think anything of it but when i grow old and learn about life it become clear that that song be a little bit suggestive that song along with the fact that the animator insist on the audience know the color of the chipettes panty this be especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes be be chase by the arabian prince men when eleanor lean over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this do nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film it one of those unexplained thing like why nobody in the world seem to mind that there be foot tall chipmunk walk around and speak in incredibly highpitched voice and treat them just like they would any human child anyway a bit after that scene the chipettes discover the diamond in the doll and decide to go find the chipmunk and get home the direction of janice karman perfect this movie a she and her husband ross bagdasarian jr. know the character good than anyone they even do the voice of the chipmunk and the chipettes ross do the voice for alvin and simon as well a dave and janice do the voice for all the chipettes and theodore speaking of male character that be voice by female voice actress nancy cartwright the voice of bart simpson make an appearance in this movie she play the part of the arabian prince a very small but important role the end be of course a happy one the crook have be catch the loose end tie and the film end when the child dave and miss miller be drive into the sunset alvin complain about not have get his dollar reward for win the race which annoy dave until he finally yell alvin and the screen fade to blackclassic end by the way i hope you find my review of this movie useful and if you havent see this flick give it a watch it worth the money this nostalgic classic from the s get a solid out of headin for the top dont you know we never stop believing now,positive

a be often the case when you attempt to take a plus page book and cram it into a two hour film a lot be lose here director john madden shakespeare in love take on an extremely ambitious project and almost pull it off what we get be a charming and emotionally compelling film that seem somehow incomplete.there be much about this film that be wonderful and fantastic the cinematography by john toll cinematographer for braveheart and legend of the fall winning oscar for both be splendid work with madden the choice for location on the greek island of kefallonia be superb and the visual image that come from photograph these majestic location in vary light be lush and beautiful madden also use numerous greek actor a the townspeople give the town an authentic feel the soundtrack be also terrific and the mandolin passage and vocal by the italian soldier be marvelous.madden do an excellent job of inging u the italian occupation and the romance which take up the great part of the film there be numerous sweet and funny moment throughout this segment however by the time the serious battle drama be ready to unfold there isnt much film leave in the reel and this component be extremely rushed and abeviated while the battle scene be well do subsequent to the battle it be obvious that increasingly great compromise be be make to keep the film from run too long by the time we reach the post war scenes the treatment be merely skeletal another negative be that the dvd be particularly sparse on features.nicholas cage be charm in the romantic lead a the sentimental captain who seem to have join the army to sing rather than fight when fight he must cage switch gear seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remain believable in both personas.penelope cruz whom the camera love give an uninspired performance a pelagia in part this be because cage so dominate the screen but cruz just seem too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic she allow the character to be objectify a corelli love interest rather than establish her a a powerful character in her own right.john hurt give a fantastic performance a the wise old doctor who know as much about human nature a medicine however christian bale seem a bit overwrought and stiff a pelagias fiancã©.i rat this film an despite some drawback this be a touching film that be well worth see the photography alone be worth the price of admission,positive

the basic genre be a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menageatrois fellowes have try to make a lot more out of this use the lie of the title in order to ing about all manner of small twist invariably design to surprise the character more than the audience.its really rather messy though fellowes doesnt seem interested present the thriller element in a fashion that will keep u seatedged rather his focus be on the moral predicament themselves.the dialogue be inconsistent stagey here vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clichã©landmine though there be no fussing over the location so that the actor can get on with exist in their space the dreadful score cant create a further dimension and often work against the emotional momentum of give set piece theres also a very prosaic dare i say it british feel to the filming i didnt want to see a document of two successful middle class people catch in an extraordinary situation i want to see some sort of artful recounting of the story.finally it be in fact the story which let the rest down just a the element of suspense be rather flat so the story be an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shape and size woven a a vehicle for character examination wilkinson and watson support this metaessay with good performance and john warnabys ebullient colleague simon to wilkinson be a welcome foil for much of the owfurrowing.im disappoint not that it bad but that it could have be much well,positive

all the way though i be think to myself oh god why at the very begin i think right it might be average but the acting and plot on most part be atrocious.every part in it be so predictable even though the first movie seem to bare a large resemblance to the ring it be a half decent movie but this just seem to take all the good thing about the first and make them terrible some bit make everyone in the audience wet themselves eg the part be geller fall off the building have me in stitch my girlfriend have to keep tell me to quiet down i be keep comment on what be bind to happen next and more time than less i be right.why do go into the house make her come after you it doesnt make sense it be a poor excuse for a lot of killing and no really depth be see at all.you can see everything come which just leave you feel that there be no point in watch oh shes behind her ... didnt see that one come yawn .surely these people must have think to ... oh i dont know carry a knife round or at least try and fight back instead of be eat but someone hair at best during the movie i be very mildly scared and i mean mildly i be just cry out for the credit a they roll i exhale a short oh thank god if you havent already dont waste your time and money on this pointless plot less sorry excuse for a sequel,negative

there be a couple of prior comment here which opine about this flick abundance of clichã©s throughout and i agree completely both with regard to the character and the dialog.id read about elizabeth berklys awful performance in the equallyawful showgirl which ive never see and her performance here while not awful be barely up to the standard of lifetime bad fare there be not a hint of depth to her character but then there probably shouldnt have be if so it would have place the film completely outofbalance since there wasnt a hint of depth or charisma not a trace in any one character performer or portrayal.the principal handle of lizs initial complaint after her tutee have kiss her in the hall be laughable her husband initial reaction and advice be likewise forrest gump attack jennys boyfriend in his car provide a more realistic intelligent action and hell he be mentallychallenged .the smarmy unctuous lawyer excuse the redundancy father of the lie student actually perform something probably worthy of praise in his performance he be both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time no mean feat her attorney be more of an insensitive nerd also not unknown in the profession.finally and frankly i rather enjoy this part the police be such a collection of insensitive oaf that youd rather depend upon barney fife without andy to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community i know that most reallike cop fall a bit short of the sharpness intelligence and empathy of the level display by most character on the law and order series and the like but dolt of this level seem to be a staple on lifetime.finally i find a kind of story within a story fascination with joshs concoction of his be the victim of his teacher this script performance within the story be even bad than his overall performance in the main story this be something of an achievement like go from f to fminus.this whole lame situation should have be resolve in real life in about minute follow a realistic meeting between teacher and school authority with husband involve but then that would have preclude the contrived drama follow and leave an hour blank film in the camera but the writer s here prove with their end they could do even worse when the situation be finally resolve and right this be accomplish in all of about second with no indication of what measure might have be forthcoming in any real world context for the perpetrator and his parent or whether they might have be able to find some sort of path toward redemption.this one a presentation the second because it do have some mild fascination,negative
if you havent see this yet you really should on dvd i cant believe how much i enjoy it it be amazingly realistic and believable true much of it be speculate and i would have like to have know more about what be speculative and what be proven fact there arent many of them but it handle everything quite well with a cruel mother nature theme it will remind you of the nature program that youve see on animal planet and the discovery channel only the animal here be dinosaur they act natural they eat kill mate play and fight for survival you will actually find yourself root for some of them and against others.for the most part the effect be excellent at time they will look a little too much like cgis but then you will see them in a different angle that make them look more realistic in some case you will actually be convince that youve see a dinosaur my favorite be the coelophysis the raptor the diplodocus the iguanadons the allosaurus and the arctic biped i be most disappointed with the trex however which look a little too computer generate at times.in any case you should definitely see this production it be educational well make and very entertaining for what it be it an a,positive

many of the review and comment i have read about this movie say that this be a rather stale film and performance by clara bow although the storyline be rather typical of claras late silents i still find it somewhat heartstirring and incredibly fun clara play a happygolucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she love ... never mind that this man be married claras lack of modesty be shock in the day but i believe it lend to the sweetness and general fun of the movie though definitely not a illiant storyline quite typical actually this movie be a nice showcase of claras ability to make the audience laugh,positive
a the number of video nasties ive yet to see dwindles this little pile of garbage pop up on my to rent list when i saw it be available.the premise involve a fashion model or something be kidnap and take into the jungle to be hold for ransom by a motley crew of idiot some other goof get hire to ing her back and be give a sack of money to use a a bargaining chip though if he return with the girl and all the money he get a significant cut he ought a helicopter and pilot with him and wow that pilot be one of the bad actor ever grant they be all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood after steal away into the jungle we learn that nearby be a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wander the wood like a human king kong look for tribeswomen to ravage and devour now this fellow be just a naked guy with some of the bad makeup ever pingpong ball for eye and thats pretty much it his growl and groan be an everpresent feature on the soundtrack and i find myself mute much of those scenes.oh do i forget to mention the almost constant nudity this be probably the main reason this film be ban though there be one specific scene about one second long where the god attack a girl and pull her gut out but it not a redeeming factor for gore fan also jess franco go beyond the usual t and a and show lengthy closeup of female genitals and sadly male a well so if you want fair in term of exploitation you get it.i cant recommend this trash to anyone it not even the good bad movie it just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then if you be make your way through the list leave this for the very last if you watch it first you may get the notion that this be the norm for the list which be certainly not true,negative

i be a huge woody allen fan and so when i saw that this be play at the cinema i couldnt help myself i want to see how allen would follow up his magnificent film match point see a this be another one of his film shoot in g.b which be unique among allens work along with what seem to be his new muse scarlett johanson scoop be much light than mp and the humor be scoop most enjoyable aspect the plot revolve around johansons character a journalism student who get a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave she fall in love with a suspected serial killer jackman and she must decide whether the truth be worth find oh and all of this be do with the help of a bumbling magician turn detective play by allen.i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed johansons performance but i be a bit bias i could watch a three hour film with johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted she play a ditsy yappy bumble sweetheart that be kind of a variation in a sense of allen stereotypical neurosis stricken character she add appropriate body language for comic effect needle to say almost anyone who see this will find johansons character sickeningly cute and that be a plus.allen be allen ... he be still play the same character much like chaplin and his little tramp character something that occur in this film make me wonder if i will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however he be not in the cast of his next picture and have be spend more time exclusively behind the camera a of late ... jackman be also enjoyable a the suave millionaire murder suspect i can not say that jackman do anything in particular to make the role his but he suit his character none the less.in term of the plot i can not help but feel that this be fresh ... in fact it stink of curse of the jade scorpion johanson and allen be more detectivelike than anything however i must applaud allen on his end because it be a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding hollywood version of this film instead of everything be black and white thing be paint in shade of gray be entirely innocent have nothing to do with it nor do unequivocal guilt though the plot seem old woody still have a knack for one liner i do find his allusion to his last film interest ... come for the humor laugh and be merry.needless to say if you enjoy allens work watch it if not watch something else ...,positive
i rent this film because of my interest in american history and especially the somewhat weird story of the mormon this movie attempt to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his vision into a major world religion it first focus on the trouble the mormon have in their settlement at navuoo illinois it portray the trial of joseph smith within the course of that trial brigham young stand up to tell of his conversion to mormonism and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith then smith be assassinate and young must deal with his own doubt about whether he have be choose to lead the mormon to a new land despite his grave doubt he persevere and finally have a vision that utah be the place for his colony that give him confidence in the rightness of his leadership later a crop be destroy by cricket he again doubt that he have truly be chosenhowever a miracle occur which cement his place in history.i find the performance to be move and the story to be convincing and interesting i would love to know whether mormon believe that this be an accurate portrayal polygamy be a part of the story but the reason why this be central to lds be not raise the issue be not emphasized.im sure people stay away from this movie because of it religious subjectmatter but it have a great cast and will hold your interest throughout,positive
s frightmare be an odd little film the director seem to be try to combine the atmosphere of classic s/s style horror movie with the shock factor of the thenexploding s slasher genre it isnt totally successful mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraint and the lessthanprofessional caliber of it cast of young actor but it still have it moment mostly due to the classy performance classy than the movie deserve by the late german actor ferdinand mayne who play an age old time horror movie star ala vincent price name conrad ratzoff at the beginning of the movie we meet the hasbeen horror star a he shoot a commercial for denture and we quickly learn that ol conrad be a bit of a hoitytoity prima donna jerkoff just when you think he couldnt be any more unlikable the commercial director berates conrad for blow a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat push him off a balcony to his death nice huh conrad then visit some fan at a college campus horror movie club unfortunately he suffer a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually end up back at his mansion wait to die still feisty even at death door he manage to do away with a despised business associate by smother him with a pillow before he finally kick the bucket himself conrad be then lay to rest in true hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screen above the casket which will play personal video message from conrad himself for visitor who enter to pay their respects.it be at this point that the kid from the college horror movie society decide to pay conrad grave an after hour visit eaking into the tomb and take his body back home with them for an all night party not exactly my idea of fun but hey these be character in an s horror film logic have no place here the college kid spend the evening have dinner with conrad body seat in a place of honor posing for photo with it and even dance around the room with it before park conrad and his coffin in the attic planning to return him to his crypt in the morning in the meantime mrs. ratzoff distraught over the theft of her husband body have call in a psychic friend to try and reach conrad through a seance you can pretty much figure out the rest from here since conrad wasnt a very nice guy in life it not much of a stretch to assume that he wont be any friendly in death psychic lady make contact with conrad and he reawaken in predictably tick off fashion then spend the rest of the movie stroll around the corridor of the student ridiculously huge house pick off the young grave robber one by one this be where the movie fall apart endless scene of teen wander around empty hallway say hello be anyone there be intercut with occasional burst of violence we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene which be the highlight of the movie before the last two survivor finally figure out way later than any semiintelligent people would have figure out the same thing ... but again be in an s horror film that the only way to stop the mayhem be to get conrad body back to it crypt where it belong the sluggish pacing be pad out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effect back by a soundtrack make up almost entirely of sound effect rather than music thunder moan and groan howl etc that become severely annoy after a while.i cant really recommend frightmare to anyone who didnt grow up watch cheap movie like this on late night cable back in the s. modern horror fan will doubtlessly find frightmare incredibly slow moving and goofy if you come of age in that magical decade however you may get a blast of nostalgia from frightmare fan of jeffrey reanimator comb may also want to check it out a the future dr. west appear in an early role here a one of the unlucky film students.i will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the eastwestdvd label pair with roy ward vault of horror and sell at dollar store because the print quality be terrible im tell the film have get a deluxe release via the fine folk at troma which seem appropriate if youre a troma kind of person then frightmare will be right up your alley,negative
people watch movie for a variety of different reason this movie didnt have the big budget theres no special effect no car chase and theres no explosion actually reality doesnt have much of these either at least not in my life this be a very real movie about very real people none of them perfect in any way but together they be put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what be different and that in turn make order out of chaos i be not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology since im neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own ain.so watch this movie for the character it be imfull of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk within the first three minute kiefer sutherland enacts detective michael haydens life superbly and he keep develop the character throughout the movie excellent act very believable henry czerny could not have be cast well and the rapport between his harvey and kiefers mickey enhance the oppositeness of their characters.i thoroughly enjoy the cranky landlady mr ramsay im sure she and my motherinlaw be good friend theres a host more of these wonderful character but space be limit here so watch the movie and enjoy them,positive
i think that you can not imagine how these people really work ... before i come to the studio to watch the guys work there i actually think quite the same a you do but since i saw and do the work the guy on that tvshow have to do i have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they be do all day long that really be no easy work and also the actor which in your eye may be terribly bad be really great people and a lot of them really can act i dont think that the material give to them can really show that a i think this material isnt very good but they be truly good so i dont think that you before you havent see these guy do there work can judge over them and i shouldnt have judge over them as well before i meet them but i do and be now terribly ashamed of it so please do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you havent see them do there job,neutral

most lorne michael film seem to fail because theyre essentially just extend version of skit that barely manage to make people laugh in fiveminute segment tommy boy be a character right from snl a big fat lovable in their opinion goof who doesnt know anything.david spade get the thankless overwhelm everyman role he pair with the annoy overweight slob and they endure miserable misfortune a they travel cross country to save daddy business.the plot for starter be really faulty the whole premise daddy dy and rich stupid son have to save the family biz can be trace back to just about any movie you want like any snl style film it be reduce to a simple motivation empty shallow just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be funny together.the movie big influence be the comedy classic plane train automobile that movie be great because the plot isnt stale and recycle it basic yeah a guy travel home for thanksgiving get stick with a slob but it real dammit it make all the difference the character be real the situation be far more real tommy boy be pure slapstick and it ridiculous situation undermine the character we feel nothing for them and we dont care about whats happen onscreen pta walk the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relateable tommy boy be simply absurd with joke like a simple deerintheheadlights turn into a crash turn into a struggle with a dead deer that really isnt dead then awakens and wreck their car.the whole wreck car thing be steal completely from pta and it eerie how much stuff in this film actually do resemble the steve martin/john candy movie.farley be simply way too obnoxious to find likable ive never enjoy watch him in any movie and this hasnt change my mind spade give very little to do serve a the movie most thankless character.dan aykroyd be waste a the evil baddie who plan to destroy daddy business the end be a joke and not in a harhar funny way more like a oh god be they serious way.some people dig it thats cool but i just cant get into it nor do i appreciate all the stuff it borrow from not just count pt a without any credit whatsoever,negative
have read during many year about how great this film be how it establish ruiz among the french critic specially the snobbish cahiers crowd when i finally watch it about a year ago i find it pretty disappoint but then i guess my expectation be skyhigh shot in saturated black and white this deliberately cereal film make for tv and mercifully only an hour long be tell in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an offscreen narrator a they ponder through a series of painting which be show in the style of tableaux vivants and try to find if they hold some clue about a hidden political crime the awful kate beckinsale film uncover have a similar argument borgesian be a word i read a lot in review about this movie but i would say almost any borges story be more interesting than this film,negative

i didnt know what to except so i think it be a lot well not have except much dont get my wrong it not a bad short film te nanavati be a relatively new directer and writer so i think she deserve a lot of kudos for make this film you can tell that it have be an act of love for her the acting outside of dominic be a little cheesy and the quality of film be not great either but for a really low budget film it good there be time when the story line get convolute and there be part that drag on though i dont feel it greatly detract for one ability to understand the film if you love dominic monaghan as much a i do i say go for it the gag reel be fun i wont spoil it but there be a particular scene that make buy the dvd worth it just so you can watch it over and over if you like the film then check out the pink mirror a film also do by jagged edge i know fan of dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven,positive

when i first hear about this movie i think it would be like the duchess but when i saw the first minute of the young victoria i know this wouldnt just be a solid movie almost everything in this movie be great the costume be really amazing and the setting be also beautifully shot.the only thing that really let me down be the performance emily blunt the devil wear prada be the star of the film inging victoria to life and with this movie she show that she be a great actress and maybe pick a first oscar nomination for her performance rupert friend be almost bland a prince albert but he have great chemistry with emily blunt paul bettany be also solid a lord melbourne although i expect more of him jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have support role but be forgettable.to me the film feel like unfinished maybe that the screenwriter change too many thing in the script i dont know but thats how i feel about the movie.but overall it a great movie about the early year of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt,positive
a fly saucer man literally by a crew of about male space explorer travel hundred of million of light year from earth to check in on a colony found some year ago on a forbidden planet what they find be a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman and her father a hermit philologist haunt by more than the demon of the ancient civilization he have immerse himself in.on the surface this story be a pulp scifi murder mystery some compare it to shakespeares tempest but this be a stretch and in some way an insult to the scifi genre strip of what make it a scifi film sure it the tempest but how many hundred of film can you say something similar about underneath this be a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for it appropriate and safe use yet the film still proceed with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from show like star trek.anne francis be not the only reason why this film be best describe a beautiful the special effect and even the aesthetic of the backdrop be powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven act almost unnoticeable if it be not for the goofy retroartdeconess of s scifi prop you might think you be watch a s piece.this be a classic of that very special subgenre of sci fi i like to call s scifi and though not in my opinion the best it be certainly a must see for anybody interested in scifi film and special effect the clever plot now render trite by it reuse in six or seven episode of star trek lose in space and even farscape be worth pay attention to and will sustain the interest of most scifi fan trekker will be particularly interested in the various aspect of the film which seem to have inspire theme of star trek original series air about year later though they may find themselves disappoint by the relatively mild s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration while i do not mean to nitpick the lack of social progress manifest in this film be the one major problem i have with it some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young goodlooking leslie nielsen in one of his first star role unfortunately nielsens performance be only average and at time downright poor especially at the climax of the film walter pigeon though quite excellent in other film overact his role as well m francis earl holliman and the amazing robby the robot be the standout actor in this crowd though on the whole the character actor fill in the ensemble do a good job the problem with the featured performance i think be as much the fault of the director and the editor a anything though they certainly get most of the film quite right,positive
i just saw this film on dvd last night and decide to check out the review this morning it seem that i robot have polarize the critical viewing community here on imdb and give rise to a lot of insult and namecalling too .i find this somewhat surprising a this film be not great or even good but neither be it terrible or even really bad what this film really be be ... depress depress that the u filmgoer population be so ready to lap up insipid clichã©d reheats and acclaim them a spectacular new work this film a retread write all over it from the plot line an uneasy mix of asimov and modernday uberaction to smiths character a smartmouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium to the special effect that borrow from matrix and a few others .i robot be sadly quite possibly the perfect action movie for today audience superficial plot insipidly snappy dialog and lot and lot of adrenaline smith be mediocre but we already know that he seem to be hollywood late unsuccessful attempt to create a black bruce willis the story have lot of hole in it of all size but i dont think most people draw to this film be criticallyminded enough to notice perhaps a blockbuster by todays standard but very bmovie compare to true winner,neutral
this be a fine example of how an interesting film can be make without use big star and big effect just tell a true story about the struggle of two african american woman over a turbulent century.this movie challenge u all to look at our own personal prejudice and see that people be people not white black etc.good movie with a good message,positive
i have buy the complete season of surface watch it in day i be so capture by the the plot theory and basically everything about this show the actor who play mile be great mile sister mother and father act like real life family would you could connect on so many level it fascinating.i find animal be so wonderful you can almost connect with them a a parent be to a child it would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly exists.am sadden that surface be not have a second season or at least four more show i have so many question that need to be answer and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book.love the show very much for those who havent watch surface if you like scifi you need to watch this,positive
this must have be one of the bad movie i have ever seen.i have to disagree with another commenter who say the special effect be okay i find them pretty bad it just wasnt realistic and they be so fake that it just distract from the actual story.maybe that distraction be the reason that i do not fully understand the story the archaeologist be look for the set they do not bother to tell what set or what be so special about it that also make it unclear why they search for it in california while the intro of the movie take place in ancient egypt.if youre shoot a movie that take place in the desert take the effort to actually go to the desert the begin the ancient ceremony look like it be shoot inside a studio instead of a desert.the actionlevel be constant throughout the movie no ups and down no climax it make the movie look short and thats certainly a pro for this particular movie,negative
liam neeson portray the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early th century he be a true actor he captivate the audience with his charisma a he do in all his role jessica lange be excellent a his wife mary mary be such a beautiful woman it her love that make rob roy the legend but it his passion that make her love undying they need each other tim roth a the evil cunningham be perfect in one way or another upon watch the movie you will find cunningham disgust the scotland scenery be beautiful the environment and condition of the time be depict quite well if you like history romance passion and love youll enjoy rob roy there be violence and blood but it unavoidable in tell this story a it should be tell no gratuitous violence and you do have to listen carefully if youre not use to a scottish accent one important point that make this movie so good be that no one actor or actress be glamorize they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scene it their skill a actor that attract you they dont rely on marquee name popularity or sex symbol appeal this be something special,positive
when i watch this movie i too get excited when see bed scene of miss world she have beautiful and charm body when cute lady do bed scene and show her fully nude body ... i think male have hard to resist .... i think it time for cute girl like hrishita bhatt also do nude scene at least no one want to c nude body of ugly woman like seema biswas to c in bandit queen.i concur with what mallicka.b have say the movie be portray in a way which appear to be a kind of vilification on the original content emotion arent convey properly i guess a couple of notsogood performance also contribute to it mediocrity in my view tabu would have be a much good choice for such a role instead of aishwarya rai in some of her scene she look a bit lusty which be not ultimately what the movie should have portray i also notice a bit of overact in some of her scene im a bitter critic of aishwarya rai cant help it sorry for that raincoat be a good movie by rituparno ghosh and i saw choker bali after see raincoat i be not at all impressed,positive

have see carlo lizzanis documentary on luchino visconti i be bind to high expectation before watch this film make three year later by adam low but the viewer like me do get dissatisfied ... i face a need for critical opinion which i generally dont like give due to the fact there be no documentary that will satisfy every viewer there be also no documentary that will examine a theme totally but when i read the review already write on this title i also felt a bit confused people sometimes dont know what to criticize therefore to be clear ill divide this film into two major part that differ considerably the former one about visconti before his director career and latter one about visconti the director the aristocratic background all the hobby the wealth that young luchino experience and enjoy be clearly present his effort in horse racing be mention as well a his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parent divorce we also get a very accurate idea of where luchino be ought up a a real count of milano in rich galore with nanny cook with access to everything in true aristocracy for instance his father splendid villa at grazzano and other marvelous villa prove that there be also an emphasis on visconti crucial visit in paris in the s where he meet eminent people leave winger who later have impact on his style and message in art that clearly explain the idea of a communist with the aristocratic up a contrast at first sight however the part about his director career which start with ossessione during wwii and end with innocente just before the director death in be poorly execute his movie be not discuss well why because there be very few people who really have something to say franco zeffirelli the director remember the work on la terra trema and that be all right there be also some interview with franco rosi but later such movie like il gattopardo la caduta dei rei la morte a venezia or ludwig be mostly discuss by helmut berger although i like the actor in the role of ludwig i do not like the interview of his moreover some thought he reveals be not accurate to entail in such a documentary ... there be no mention of significant work of visconti like conversation piece there be no interview with eminent cast burt lancaster a mention about silvana mangano and romy schneider should also be make there be one footage interview with maria calla that appear to be interesting but that be only a short bit franco zeffirelli though i appreciate him a a director make fun of it all rather than say something really precious for instance he mention the event how visconti separate from him after year of service therefore i say simplify and unsatisfactory what i find a strong point here be footage interview with visconti himself a a result we may get his own opinion about his work for instance i very much appreciate the word he say about death regard it a a normal chapter of life and as natural a birth itself he also discuss his health problem after the stroke while film ludwig.i believe it be well to see luchino visconti by carlo lizzani than this doc although it be short and condense a a whole you will get a good idea of the director visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turn people emotion and viewpoint into stone ...,positive

i saw it at the legacy theater in the joseph smith memorial building in salt lake city this morning im go to assume that one level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be base on one level of acceptance of joseph story.however that aside it be very well make well acted and have a nice score if you get to salt lake city it be a must to see it in the legacy theater i have never be in a nice theater as far a picture quality sound quality and ambiance in my entire life ... i wonder if the church would let me watch batman begin there be that im lds and regard joseph a a prophet i be touch in several place and be ought to tear quite a few time ... which i presume be expect since they hand out tissue before the movie start anyway im tell that this film be available in several lds visitor center around the globe if you have minute check it out because whether you believe joseph smith or not he tell a fascinating story,positive

i first saw this movie when i be about year old my mom buy it at our local kmart because it be on sale for on vhs she think that it would be a nice christmas movie for me and my others to watch this movie however scar the hell out of me you may be ask yourself how could a movie about santa clause scare anyone the plot of the movie revolve around satan send one his minion pitch to earth in an attempt to kill santa and ruin christmas thats right satan send a demon up from hell to kill santa clause pitch stalk santa throughout christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rise on christmas day for if santa doesnt make it back to his home in space he turn to powder dont get me wrong the movie be funny and fairly entertaining however the image of demon and devil dance in the depth of hell which occur at the beginning of the movie be just downright creepy,negative
although there be some snippet in this part documentary hint at the necessity for recreational drug law reform these be not very welldeveloped in contrast to the many snippet from those who feel that the drug that happen to currently be illegal be a scourge for which the only imaginable solution be incarceration of even those who be guilty even of mere possession of such drugs.although this program a a whole leave the viewer with the impression that the drug war be largely a futile exercise and a waste of money and for that it deserve some praise almost nothing in this documentary address the very real problem that total war against those who merely possess illegal drug obviously cause and contributes tovery real problem that most drug warrior themselves would tell you if ask they think the drug war be design to solve for example while many minute be spend on the surge in violence associate with the rise popularity of crack cocaine in the s at no point do this program even hint that the very law design to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug seller to enforce their contract and business arrangement in court of law force them to resort to violence to stay in business but instead of see the law a an important cause of the violence the drug themselves seem to take the unt of the blame inexplicably alcohol prohibition the violence that ensue and the subsequent reversal of prohibition be totally ignore by this program.this program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotype of drug user and it be these that be the primary force in drive the very expensive and very problematic drug war the possibility of incorporate drug other than alcohol into a happy and successful life be not really touch on use of any drug in excess be probably go to cause personal problem but not all user do their drug in excess just like not all alcohol user be alcoholics.if you want a point of view from someone who believe that adult have a moral right not to be incarcerate and have their life ruin by the criminal justice system just for use drug that the government for mostly very arbitrary political reason rather than reason base on sound social policy and legitimate science have decide to totally prohibit whose user it have decide to notsometaphorically wage war against just forget about it none of that be in here.on the other hand this be hardly in the category of antidrug propaganda it be mostly an interesting neutrallypresented history of drug in th century united state like marijuana lsd heroin cocaine mdma and oxycontin but there be a significant element of various people point of view with regard to drug law and most but not all of that be not very thoughtful or wellinformed and slant in favor of the drug warrior mentality especially with respect to drug other than marijuana the criminal justice system along with it often harsh liferuining penalty be obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem but unfortunately theres an epidemic in this nation of an asyet unnamed disease whose primary symptom be a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it come to certain drug a lack of compassion for fellow human a prejudice against people who use the drug that be not governmentallyapproved perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison/policing industry and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity it morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for do so and the mere possession of an arbitrarily select group of drug be clearly not such a reason this be really the primary issue when it come to drug yet this program ignore it.so in sum the part of this program that neutrally present history without feed stereotype of drug user that be at the heart of the drug war mentality be pretty good and interesting and entertain but when it come to present a rational nonradical point of view with regard to drug policy and give the viewer examples not only of people with drug problem but also the many people who successfully incorporate drug into happy and successful live it pretty disappointing,negative

i decide to watch this movie because id not see carol lombard before in any movie im sorry it have to be this one because quite frankly this be a dog â– and even with jimmy stewart and charles coburn both of whom be great actors.the problem with the film be simple it try to put too much too quickly in to a story about a young lawyer john manson play by stewart who marry jane play by lombard within an hour of meet her whats that clichã© marry in haste repent at leisure ... in short the story be a series of episode that show the couple worsen financial status their trouble with john livein mother their struggle to pay the bill johns diminish status at the office the arrival of their baby son john jnr unexpected and cause additional friction at home with mother the couple angst about their marriage the baby sickness which worsen thus necessitate an heroic flight by a lone pilot in a fierce storm to ing a special serum to save the child and finally john be accept a a junior partner at the law firm.how many more clichã©d situation could the writer include maybe mother die soon after there wasnt much comedy the drama be lacklustre at best the dialog be painful to hear only the acting of the four main player be adequate.this be the period at the end of the great depression with the usa come out of it long downturn â– during which many people experience all of the event portray in the movie.so it make sense for selznick to reaffirm good ol home spun american value of family relationship heroism perseverance and initiative â– all against the backdrop of the average american family who well to use than jimmy stewart and carol lombard and it should be note that the film be release in early so it be plan in â– soon after the usa begin to get production go for the coming world war ii hence this sort of film be a great booster for the general public at that time many of who would soon have to join england in war a many here would know hollywood and washington form an uneasy alliance before during and after the war.however im glad i saw it â– a a piece of disguised sociopolitical propaganda but ill have to see other lombard film to gain a good appreciation of her act range.as another reviewer note see this one just to say that youve see all of stewart movie otherwise dont bother,positive
unfortunately the only spoiler in this review be that there nothing to spoil about that movie.even if b. mattei have never do any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that make him a fun eurotrash director but for the last year he seem to have lose it.this film be just empty nothing at all to wake u up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first min.no sex no blood it suppose to be about snuff no actor no dialog just as bad a an t.v film.its even bad than his last cannibal and zombie epics.so rest in peace bruno you will stay in our mind forever anyway thanks to such unforgettable gem a zombi robowarrats laltro infernovirus cruel jaw and few others.so except if you want to see b mattei possess by jess franco spirit new film pas on this one.but if you dont know this nice artisan career track down his old film and have fun,negative

hypothetical situation abound onetime director harry ralston give u the ultimate postapocalyptic glimpse with the world dead left in the street in the store and throughout the landscape sans in the middle of a forgotten desert one lone survivor attempt to rekindle his sanity take food from the city to his bungalow in this desert all alone he hop for more but with nobody around he be leave with white underwear and a passion for a local indian tribe â– until the discovery of a camera which open up new door and eaks the barrier of human coexistence alan a man of the book be leave on earth after an unknown disaster thinking he be alone he begin live life his way â– until jeri ryan appear like she would in any dream out of the wood dishevel and unhappy to find the final man alive to be ... well ... like alan anyway they try to coexist fail get drunk and before create the ultimate dystopia they run into redneck raphael play by newcomer â– dan montgomery jr bond be torn confusion set in a couple become a third wheel and the battle between physically inept nerd vs. ainless jock even with nobody leave on the planet it become a truth that even the dark of human nature will arise.using a variable film technique ralston give u a mediocre story base loosely on another film entitle the quiet earth which i will be view next oddly which he never give any credit towards with a borrowed story i guess he do a decent job of reinterpret it his punch seem to be lack at the begin while ralston try to find his stride borrowing yet again from other film director technique to attempt to find his own he open the film interestingly enough but fail to answer any direct answer sure the final day have arrive but could there be a concise answer a to how or good yet why these select few survive a spookier begin would have lead u strong into a comical film the juxtaposition would have be like shawn of the dead but instead leave u feel like we be watch a madefortv program listening to the audio commentary i have respect for ralston because he work diligently to get this film make and his passion nearly sell the film but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasnt a happy with his overall final product there be mistake one that he point out and others that he be ashamed to point out while this do make for decent independent filmmaking it sometimes feel cheap and in ralstons case it be the latter.i must admit david arnotts portrayal of alan hook me he play that wimpy school nerd adult role very well he be funny to both watch and listen to and thus he become sympathetic to the viewer he be a key player in keep the film together ala i can not say the same for the rest this be dan montgomery first film and it be obvious â– i mean â– really really obvious there be scene in which i think the cue card be about to come out and read the line for him perhaps even give u a more realistic performance but alas it wasnt the case then there be jeri ryan she pull into her character near the end of the film which to me be the culmination of the entire piece of art she go from estrange unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end confuse again she fell into her character by the end give u just a glimpse of what she could have probably do a her acting mature even a the commentary progress all that she contribute be a laugh giggle or ohhh look at that color moment while her beauty may sell ticket one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful this be her first film so can i be too harsh overall this film felt like it be miss something i though the idea be strong â– the premise that even with only a peppering of people remain on the earth the evil of human nature still exist jealousy can not be kill by bacteria or bomb maybe because it be consume by zinc and we a a race will always want what we can not have ralston be not a surprising director his technique be flaw and preused but he do know how to make a lowbudget comedy i think our idea of funny be different so that be why i couldnt find myself laugh at many of the bit he find hysterical his actor provide the level of act need for this film which be low than average his film be loose meaning that there be element never quite explain or tackle i.e anything with wing survive which overall harm the intensity of the film this be a comedy but it could have be much darker and much much funny for those think that roger avery be a huge element to this film a we learn from their commentary all he be there for be money â– the be in essence the bank for the last man dont get your hope up for any classic avery moments.dont expect more from ralston â– and that be how i will end it.grade out of,positive
i must admit i be expect something quite different from my first viewing of cut last night though be delight with the unexpected australian horror gem i be a true horror fan as true a they come and find cut to not only be the best of the genre australia have ever produce but one of the great parody/comedy film of late.my only concern be that mainstream audience may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements the film be not overly clever in it application but make me laugh at every turn try to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could i be certain this be intend a humour .... hop this be intend a humour.and of course there be the gore.the use of the customise garden shear be illiance besides the expect stab and slash in short there be a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent death enough to please even the skeptic of this film worth.the appearance of both kylie minogue short that her appearance be and molly ringwald be just another reason to see the film both performance be fantastic as well a simon bossell the castle in a illiant role a the jokey technician.all in all i think this movie be one of the best horror product of the last couple or year as well a a beautiful satire/parody toungueincheek till the very end.loved it go see it,positive
i be so happy not to live in an american small town because whenever im show some small town in the state it be populate with all kind of monster among whom flesh hungry zombie evil alien and sinister ghost be most harmless in this movie a former doctor who just do time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car crash direct his step to the near small town he must have never in his life see a flick about any small town which happen to be the purgatory flat and of course as soon a he arrive there all the hell eaks loose he meet a blond chick who out of all creature most resembles a cow both in facial expression and in ain functioning and at once fall in love with her but there be a tiny handicap she be already marry to a very smalltime drug dealer who in a minute get himself shot pitifully not dead to know what have come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself ill just tell you that it slightly reminiscent of u turn by oliver stone but be a way down in all artistic property,negative
like anyone else who buy this i be dupe by the piece of extreme gore and ban in country or whatever it say in the box i have to admit i be a huge gore fan and i be always amaze when film can lay it on thick and look convince do it tom savini rick baker and greg cannom be some of the best in the business the revolutionize makeup effect in the s. today you dont need them a everything be do on computer but computer can not compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up but i digress.watching fantastically gory film like fulcis gate to hell or even savinis crown achievement friday the th the final chapter you can appreciate all that go into make a terrifically gory film you cant tell the difference between reality and magic.i cant imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal ferox but the gore that be ostensibly omnipotent in this film if that be the reason you seek this film then you be waste your money a many other reviewer in here have note most of the gore be an aftermath you dont see the torture or the bloodshed a it happen you see whatever it look like afterwords.the gore well it here but not as much a one would hope or expect a man do get castrate and a woman do get hang by her east but other then those two scene and one involve a scalping there be nothing really much else to this film the scene of gore even in these three mentioned be still pretty tame in comparison to what you be hop for maybe it just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre but i be expect a bit more call me sick or twisted but isnt that the only reason people be watch this film in the first place i honestly find myself bore in a lot of places.cannibal ferox be just another film that try to capitalize on a craze of a superior film while cannibal holocaust be not exactly a great film it be much good than this tripe if you go out of your way to buy this for you will feel cheated./,positive

i want very much to believe that the above quote specifically the english subtitle translation which be actually write not speak in a rejection letter a publisher send to the protagonist be mean to be selfreferential in a tongueincheek manner but if so director leos carax apparently neglect to inform the actor of the true nature of the film they be all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayal that i have to conclude carax actually take himself seriously here or else have so much disdain for everyone especially the view audience that he cant be bother let anyone in on the joke.some auteur be able to get away with make oblique bizarre film because they do so with ã©lan and unique personal style e.g david lynch and alejandro jodorowsky others use a subtler approach while still weave surreal element into the faic of the story e.g krzysztof kieslowski and david cronenbergs later less bizarre work in pola x carax throw a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dare him to find fault with it well here it be the pacing be erratic and choppy in particular continuity be often dispense with superfluous character abound e.g the gypsy mother and child most of the performance be overwrought the lighting be often poor particularly in the oftdiscussed sex scene unconnected scene be thrust into the film for no discernible reason and the list go on.not to be completely negative it should be note that there be some uplifting exception i like the musical score even the cacophonous industrialtechno music be play in the sprawling abandon complex to which the main character retreat in the second half of the film perhaps a reference to andy warhols factory of the s much of the photography of the countryside be beautiful an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city setting and even well into middleage cathering deneuve show that she still have it her performance be also the only one among the major character that didnt sink into bathos.there be an early time when i would regard such film a pola x more charitably experimentation be admirable even when the experiment doesnt work but carax try nothing new here the film be a pastiche of element borrow from countless earlier film and after several decade of movieviewing and literally thousand of film later i simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal poorly craft tripe at this early moment in the st century one be leave ask with the exception of jeanpierre jeunet be there any director in france who know how to make a watchable movie anymore rating,negative
it hard to praise this film much the cgi for the dragon be well do but lack proper modelling for light and shadow also the same footage be use endlessly of the dragon stomp through corridor which become slightly tedious.i be amaze to see marcus aurelius in the act credit wonder what an exemperor of the roman empire be do act in this film like whoopie goldberg it must be an alias and can one blame him for use one if he appear in this stinker.the story might be interest but the acting be flat and direction be tedious if you must watch this film go around to your friend house and get drink while do so then itll be enjoyable,positive

although it stray away from the book a little you cant help but love the atmospheric music and settings.the scene in bath be just how they should be although if you have watch it a many time a i have you notice that the background people be the same in each scene but that aside i like the scene where they be in the hot bath but do the men and woman really bathe together like that you could see all the men perch around the outside leering at the woman it also seem strange that they all have their hat on but perhaps this be the style at the time the ballroom scene be very nice the dancing and the outfit look beautiful i especially like catherine dress in the first ballroom scene.northanger abbey look suitably impose but i enjoy the bath scene better.schlesinger give a good but not exceptional performance a catherine morland googie withers give the best performance a mrs allen i feel.ugh peter firth a mr tilney he just talk a load of rubbish and be not a clergyman a he should be it hard to think of him be in love with catherine but then the book never really give that impression either.general tilney be play reasonably well by hardy and stuart also give a sort of good performance a isabella ingrid lacey do not give a good performance a elinor tilney a for john thorpe well he give the impression of a seedy and lustful man perhaps not the character portray in the book but i quite like it.i can handle scene be cut from a book adaptation but when new scene and character be add it usually annoy me the marchioness i hate her she be not part of the northanger story and neither be her cartwheeling page boy.some of the script be peculiar when catherine be ask elinor tilney about her mother death she ask i suppose you saw the body how do it appear what a silly thing to say elinors calm response be stupid too.anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me,positive

this movie come a a huge disappointment the anime series end with a relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of a pretty lame villain but i expect shamballa to tie up all the loose end unfortunately it didnt it add more plot hole than it resolve and confuse more than it clarify the animation and voice act be great but with an idiotic plot dull set most of the movie doesnt even take place in dull wwii earth rather than the alchemy world and disappointing end ed be useless for the rest of his day in a world with no alchemy and he ditch winry it be altogether pretty lackluster do yourself a favor disregard the last half of the anime as well a this movie and read the manga,negative

i watch this movie so that you dont have to i have great respect for kris kristofferson but what be he think he do this for scale at least the films title practice truth in advertising since people and object routinely disappear throughout the film add to the confusion kristofferson mention this in his commentary that even he wasnt sure if genevieve bujolds character really exist this do not bode well for the viewer be able to follow the story the making of feature be far more interesting than the movie itself it explore the difficulty cobble together fund for an indie even a the film be be shot.to it credit this movie be visually pleasing and doesnt in any way look like a movie make with just slightly over m. too bad the money wasnt spend on a good project,neutral
just saw this movie on open night i read some other user comment which convince me to go see it ... i must say i be not impressed im so unimpressed that i feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money.first of all the messenger be very predictable and just not much of a thriller it might be scary for someone under but it really do nothing for me the climax be laughable and most of the audience leave before the movie resolution.furthermore the acting seem a little superficial some of the emotional argument between the family be less convince than the subpar suspense scenes.if youve see preview for this movie then youve see most of the best part and have a strong understanding of the plot this movie be not worth see in the theater,positive

a wellmade runofthemill movie with a tragic end pluses the way the story move begin with soorya struggle to live follow by a long flashback about why he there the music a disinterested look at the life of policeman minuses the violence and the gore but i guess they add to the realistic effect still have people head chop off and send in box and sack could have be avoided.no complaint,negative
i dont understand the positive comment make about this film it be cheap and nasty on all level and i can not understand how it ever get made.cartoon character abound sue foulmouthed alcoholic layabout irish father be a prime example none of the character be remotely sympathetic except iefly for sue asian boyfriend but even he then turn out to be capable of domestic violence a desperately unattractive a they both be ive no idea why either rita and/or sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like bob but give that they do why should i be expect to care what happen to them so many review keep carp on about how realistic it be if that be true it be a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film.i didnt like the film at all,negative

one of my favorite show back in the s. a i recall it go to air on friday or possibly saturday night on the nine network here in australia darren mcgavin and simon oakland be great together.each episode usually reach a climax with kolchack have to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent to their credit the writer make a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampire and ghost as much a possible.i remember one episode in which the adversary be the spirit of an ancient indian chief which/who come back a a massive electrical current which start to kill people in a city hospital the final showdown saw kolchack try to short circuit the power beast amidst an explosion of spark and billow flame oh well .... you have to be there at the time but it be an interesting idea.mcgavin always pack a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his role and this be one of his best.definitely deserve a place in tvs hall of fame to quote tony vincenzo .... kolchack you be on it ... or in the case of the hall of famein it,positive
i think my summary say it all this mtvish answer to the classic candid camera tv show feature a gen x or be that gen y type put in false chopper and wear various hat and wig and glass and set people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situation example kennedy have a guy invite his parent to his wedding kennedy be the ide do up in a full idal gown and long wig the joke be that the parent immediately understand their son be marry a man who claim to no longer have his bit and piece problem be this schtick go on way too long obviously to fill out time and kennedy be about as funny a a dead cod lie in the sun candid camera would have run three or four scenario in the time it take kennedy to get through this one run around constantly ask do i look fat i recognize the show be not make for me it be make for yearold pinhead who think jackass be the height of comedy today so let them laugh thank god the show be shortlived,neutral
frownland be like one of those intensely embarrassing situation where you end up laugh out loud at exactly the wrong time and just at the moment you realize you shouldnt be laugh youve already reach the pinnacle of voice resoundness and a you look around you at the ghostly white face with their gaping wideopen mouth and glazen eye you feel a piercing ache begin in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rush up your throat and ... well you get the point.but for all it unpleasantness and punch in the face frownland really be a remarkable piece of work that after view the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic trouble and mishap make you want to scratch your own eye out and at the same time you feel sickenly sorry for him.it would have be a lot easy for me to simply walk out of ronald bronsteins film but for some insane reason i felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film have to offer if someone set you on fire you typically want to put it out stop drop and roll but with this film you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body you endure the painperhaps out of spite or some unknown masochistic curiosity i cant even begin to attempt to explain.unfortunately mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you but if you get a chance to catch it prepare yourself ing a doggie bag,negative
i saw this movie while surf through infomercial and latenight s sitcom on tv one night at in the morning i must say i didnt expect much and i didnt get much although rise mcgowan be hot her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast be not oscarworthy to say the least this movie have it ups and down and do have a nice couple of twist at the end but in all honesty it be awful not even a typical slasher movie no gore no sex no nudity no real violence just bad act id give it a out of,negative
i first saw this film when i be about year old on tv in the uk where it be call laupta the fly island i absolutely love it and be heartoken when it be repeat a while later and i miss it i be enchant by the story and character but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music it would have be the original english dub version which i saw sometimes erroneously refer to a the streamline dub the dub be actually by ghibli themselves and only distribute by streamline which be sadly unavailable except a part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc boxset.unfortunately i feel that the release have be partly spoil by disney the voice acting be ok but the dialogue doesnt have the same raw energy that the streamline dub or the original japanese have and i think james van der beek sound too old to play the lead they have make some pointless alteration such a change the main character name from pazu to patzu and add some dialogue but bad of all i feel that they have ruin many scene with intrusive music the opening scene of the airship for example be originally silent but have be spoil thanks to disneys moronic requirement that there be music play whenever anyone be not speak which i find annoy in many disney films.this film still blow away most recent animated film and i can not recommend it highly enough the plot be simple yet captivate and the film show a flair which be sadly miss from most modern massmarket homogenize animation,negative
this film cant make up it mind whether it message be human be evil and bad and animal be sweet and blameless or dont ever go in the water again a fisherman nolan be out to nab a killer whale a very bad thing but when he accidentally accidentally mark you hit a pregnant cow instead of her mate the cow and i use the word in all sens who be obviously a sick psychobitch and the canonical villain of the piece throw herself against the propeller try to chew herself to bit in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of kill herself i doubt it be her first when her unborn fetus abort from her hideous selfinflicted wound her mate go mental with revenge and swears to hurt kill and mutilate every human who even so much a talk to nolan obviously a among human total psycho date other total psychos.the film reek of halfthought out antihuman message the poor poor whale the evil men must suffer and die and yet it do not succeed in demonize nolan at all it true that when he set out his motif be selfish and cruel but at the first squeal of the first whale he grow a heart and a the film progress he grow more and more compassionate to the whale pain until it seem he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale just to make it feel a little better.the film final journey in which nolan follow the whale on a bizarre journey to the north remind me of melville eerie manwhale connection and for a moment hint at a truly interesting conclusion where these two husband might connect understand even respect each other in their own grief for nolan lose his wife and unborn child also to an accident it clear nolan respect the whale and feel for it loss however it never go there the whalecharacter have no compassion or respect for anyone.the final scene lose this focus and become jawslike where the seamonster finally kill everybody and nolan and nodoubt through an oversight fail to chomp up the whalehugger tho he make a good snap for her head a little early i love animal and i detest whale and what be more i love orca whale but if this films goal be to make me feel that the whale be the victim and that people be evil and detestable it completely fail nolan show compassion and growth and feel for others and all the whale think about be kill and maiming.the only message one can walk away with be if you see an orca whale ever anywhere run the other way cause if you step on his fin the wrong way he will hunt you to the end of the earth destroy everything around you,negative

a plot that fizzle and reek of irreconcilable difference in opinion constitute a judgmental havoc with one side prolife and the other a destroyer of a demon seed the horror be leave out and replace with an overall dull effect quite possibly mean to be horrific but instead demonstrate an ill dose of belief which ridicule each other to death despite the title itself be a fan of master of horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot twist with it sordid depiction crash apart like a spindly old rock chair after be sat upon i view this episode a be throw together from the get go never really take off anywhere other than to see it through for what it worth and relieve when it finally come to the end ..,negative
scott menville be not casey kasem that be the first most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt at reimagining scoobydoo and company.shaggys voice be squeaky and do not sound anything like he have ever sound in any of the previous incarnation of the scooby show theyve also change the outfit and the classic mode of walk from the original.im not sure what theyre on about yet with the villain angle but it surely isnt follow the formula use in any of the previous scooby shows.and the animation style be very bizarre and distort i like it but it not real scoobydoo type animation but the weird animation use for other wb show grow on me this might too.its worth a glance at once if you can handle the lack of proper shaggy voice that right there be enough to jar one out of enjoy the show properly besides i be try not to be an inflexible nitpicking fan evolve or die a the saying go well see how it look after two more episode by then ill have form a much more solid opinion,negative
i often wonder how movie like this even get make and the most shocking part be that people actually pay to watch them.with aksar it appear a though the director make up the story a he go along add twist and turn when he like no matter how ludicrous they be the script be non existent with inane dialog such a jo sheena roy pehenti hai wahee fashion hota hai and yeh versace hai madam yeah right .every one of the character be shallow and underdeveloped acting be awful constumes lycra for udita and awful suit for a stocky emran locales the numerous house that be use for interior do not even vaguely resemble a victorian mansion screenplay etc etc just one word rubbish.for those people who love hashmi and his movie watch it a for me ill never get those two and a half hour back the only redeeming factor be some of the music which be decent,negative

donald pleasance and peter cushing unite in one horror film that always sound like a terrific plan two of the most versatile cult actor of their generation who previously already star together in terrific genre outing like the flesh and the fiend and from beyond the grave pair up in a mids satanic theme exploitation flick how can this possibly go wrong well unfortunately it can to my deepest regret land of the minotaur can hardly even be call mediocre and that in spite of the cast the exotic set the appeal title and the potentially great sound premise in a remote little area in greece more particularly near an archaeological site multiple tourist vanish because baron peter cushing and his docile follower keep feed them to a fireeathing minotaur statue cushing who never look more bored and uninterested in any role he play before own a giant medieval castle and apparently in greek this mean you also own the complementary archaeological ruin and an underground network of cavern that be of course quite handy if your hobby be the kidnapping of random camper and amateur archaeologist when three of his young friend also mysteriously disappear in the same area father roch the priest of a couple of town before decides to investigate land of the minotaur be a boring and extremely slowpaced horror effort that never really undertake any major attempt to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesnt bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating element and pagan trivia detail the titular minotaur for example be an intriguing creature of greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepen out the significance instead the film focus on tedious and overly talkative sequence and loud inappropriate music alter with experimental noise the only reason to even consider give this major disappointment of a film a chance be because of donald pleasance his portrayal of rude bossy and oldfashioned priest who criticize everything that represent modern youth be powerful and reliable a always,negative

i find this to be a surprisingly lighthanded touch at a s cultureclash movie john wayne would hardly be one first choice a a cultural attache be about a diplomatic with his good intention a a bullrun in harrod but this time he be leave to play a part that be far more passive than his usual bluff persona and he accomplish his task with style the duke be a guy who really could act well his facial expression and body language could be extremely subtle.despite his considerable presence both a an actor and in term of screen time he fail to dominate this movie many of his good intention come a cropper he have authority over nobody and the intermittent narrative be provide by the titular geisha to whom he be the barbarian.the story of american attempt to curry favour with an isolationist japan be one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hellforleather battle i can not comment on the accuracy of it research but the strangeness of the oriental culture to western sensibility be demonstrate well there be a great deal of minutelychoreographed ceremony entail what look to this observer like authentic costume and prop the set piece be complex and detail a lot of money and thought have be apply to it.the fractured romance between wayne and his geisha add a little extra element and stop the movie become just a political or flagwaving effort script be good without be too wordy there be a great deal of japanese dialogue but the lengthy period of translation didnt interfere with the narrative it be nice to see plenty of genuine oriental on the set whether or not they be japanese i couldnt say but anyway they look the part at least the lead be not play by crossdressing caucasian unlike other effort such a blood alley yes i know they be chinese the inn of the sixth happiness or even the king and i.frankly i enjoy this more than any of those other movie the script be good for a start i never like the song in the king and i and wasnt impress by the heavyladen anticommunist subtext of blood alley i confess to never have see this work before and find it compare very favourably to many of the duke more popular outings.recommended,positive

truly appalling waste of space me and my friend try to watch this film to it conclusion but have to switch it off about minute from the end and i can count the film i have switch off before the end on one hand.the script and direction be leaden and deeply uninspiring i wouldnt be surprise if they find the script in a pile of cast off script from for example the irritating scroat threaten the real estate guy from his house phone i mean seriously the police would be beat his door down in minute the scene and event just wash by you like turd in a river it be difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film the narrative flick between character in a seemingly random manner eaking up the pathetic attempt at build the character oh and what character they be the protagonist play by rourke be dreadful he could have just send a cardboard cut out of himself and stay in bed after or so minute of the film i have build absolutely zero attachment to this character he be neither sympathetic nor hateful just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blunder through every single scene his motivation be impossible to discern from his generally mumble and emotionless delivery be he happy be he sad angry no idea just those same dead eye star out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh and the native american theme be just awful and pointless.the good guy be at best unlikeable a dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic exwife stereotype cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy you arent go to shoot me that be both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying.the richie nix character seem interest at first but soon descend into an irritate one side psycho character which seem at odds with the seem intention of make the bad guy in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivated.roasario dawson character start with some promise but soon descend into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangster chick scene from jackie brown you really want me to believe her character be so attracted to rourkes or bad she be just a floozy who sleep with anything that move realistic female character ftw in summary a complete mess of a film hopeless characterisation and performances a leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction and ultimately extremely dull it not even comedy bad either laugh at rourkes haggard face get pretty old after sit through the first turgid minute of the film,negative

one could wish that an idea as good a the invisible man would work good and be more carefully handle in the age of fantastic special effect but this be not the case the story the character and finally the entire last minute of the film be about as fresh a a madscientist flick from the early s. there be some great moment mostly due to the amazing special effect and to the very idea of an invisible man stalk the street but ala soon be back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab which mean that the rest of the film be not only predictable but schematic.there have be a great many remake of old film or tv show over the past year and some of them have their charm but it become clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of put ol classic under the nose of eager madman like verhoeven who do have his moment be a very bad one it be obvious that the money be the key issue here the time and energy put into the script be nowhere near enough and a a result hollow man be seriously undermine with clichã©s sappy character predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever.however the one thing that actually impress me beside the special effect be the swearing when make this kind of film modern producer be very keen on allow kid to see them therefore the language and sometimes the violence and sex be very toned down when the whole world blow up the good guy go oh darn and oh my god hollow man gratefully discard that kind of hypocrisy and the character be at liberty to say what come most natural to them im not say that the most natural response to something go wrong be to swear but it make it more believable if someone actually swear i think we can thank verhoeven for that,positive

this film be where the batman franchise ought to have stop though i will concede that the idea behind batman forever be excellent and could have be easily realise by a competent director a it turn out this be not to be the case.apparently warner brother executive be disappoint with how dark this second batman film from tim burton turn out apart from the idiocy of expect anything else from burton and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the sixty tv series i fail to understand how batman return can be consider at all disappointing.true it be not quite the equal of the first film though it repair all the minor deficiency of style find in batman a weak script that split the antagonism between not just two but three character invite unflattering comparison to the masterful pairing of keaton and jack nicholson a the joker in the first film yet for all this it remain a gorgeously dark film true to the way the batman be always mean to be and highly satisfying.michael keaton return a the batman and his alter ego bruce wayne tangle with nouveau riche tycoon max schreck christopher walken name in honour of the s german silent actor his partnerincrime oswald cobblepot the penguin danny devito in illiant makeup reminiscent of laurence olivier richard iii and selina kyle the catwoman michelle pfeiffer whom wayne romance both a himself and a the batman the four principal turn in excellent performance especially walken and devito while together keaton and pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities.there be some intriguing concept in this film about the only weakness i can really point out be a certain limpness to the script in some place which i think be due mostly to the way this film be a fourcornered fight there simply isnt enough time to properly explore whats go on.nevertheless this be a damn good film i highly recommend watch this in conjunction with the first and then weep for how good the series could have be have it continue under burton and keaton,positive
the quick and the undead be finally the first movie to actually render it own storyline null and void it be essentially one gigantic plot hole.aside from that the acting be quite bad character motivation nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasnt a single character worth hang our hat on the most interesting cast member who have great potential to be a dark horse protagonist get snuffed halfway through the proceedings.what the quick and the undead do serve a be an excellent example of how to do good colortiming it look excellent when you take into account budget considerations.unfortunately it play out like a guy get his hand on a hundred grand and watch a few western most notably the good the bad and the ugly and then just throw a bunch of element haphazardly into a movie ... you know they have movie where character do this do it fit here no but who care they do it in other movie so i should do it here maybe a good view for burgeon cinematographer and colorist firstyear filmschoolers otherwise a mustmiss,positive
i be stun by this film afterwards i didnt even want to see any film for a long time any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison.for many it may be the bad of antonioni very slow without an engaging conventional story line microscopic examination of human emotion and interaction and the bad of wenders verbose confused transcendentalism it be compose of short distinct episode link by wenders typical meander heros stream of consciousness so it doesnt produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema.but for fan the bad be the best and the disjointed story line be sketch a single poetic image that stretch across the film wenders and antonioni create a discourse between their segment that seek out the heart of thing,negative
be i the only person who think that the entire forensics and scene of crime community in the usa must detest this almighty slap in their face a rookie cop be first to a crime scene where her back up be so slow to respond that she have time to send the kid who find the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera by the time he return still no senior cop socos or other assistance for the lovely jolie this be new york isnt it it have start rain and she get to work photograph the evidence only after shed stood in front of an amtrak to stop it disturb the scene.i want to know the name of that camera a the photograph be so incredibly detail that no amount of zoom in distort the image the horror continue not in the film itself pretty ordinary im afraid but in the lincoln rhyme character a play by mr washington this man be a highly dedicate forensic crime scene examiner with year of experience who instead of the highly trained but invisible local crime scene examiner entrust the work to an untrained cop a rookie cop who proceed to find the very obviously place clue and move them before photograph them thus contaminate every item and make dna profile well nigh impossible now that be a ight idea eh i know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film be intelligent must have entirely disengage their ability to think in order to find this film believable.i have give this film for the superb acting of denzel washington and for miss jolies lip which be the only item require my disbelief to be suspend,negative

this be the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film ive see in full the first be rope which i really enjoy with saboteur hitchcock be more room to roam free whereas rope take place all in one room i didnt enjoy this one as much a rope but thats not say this be a bad film it just seem like an average flick that could have be something more.it seem like a film hitchcock would make a a eak in between his more serious one a a thriller i feel it fail to really get my on the edge of my seat or engage with the lead character who be run around the state the climax of the film feel like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension the sound design be almost non existent you can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them but the important thing be miss the stitch rip apart from the sleeve the need of music to amp of the tension all miss intentional no doubt yet it lack the emotional punch one would want from such a scene then it end auptly leave you empty inside.the film doesnt feel like it should either they be almost globe trot from place to place yet it feel more confine the script itself be very average and seem to go about the more obtuse way to get the plot moving.the performance be there but nothing amazing everyone play their part to script word on the page the relationship between the two lead be weak and need more work the one stand out be otto kruger who have that rich ego evil persona down pat.in the end i want more from this one i understand it one of hitchcock least exciting film but i do have a good time watch it i can recommend it just not enthusiastically,negative

let me first off say that i be a believer of ghost and i do indeed know they exist i have have enough experience with them to know they be there.what i hate be the people who ing the bible and religion into all of this people forget there be more than one bible thousand of religion and belief and different way to interpret what be say in the bible not everyone believe in god and not everyone believe in stereotypical religion religion do not make everything fact one of the thing i should mention in the bible that many do not know be that even the most rampant bible thumper be eaking the very rule write within .... you be suppose to never wear more than one faic at one time slavery be ok and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstance none of this oh that be the old testament and now we have the new testament if the bible be the word of god and can not be change .. there should be no change or version religion be full of misinterpretation mixed fact and people who so blindly follow it that there be no other way the excuse these say blind follower use be either pathetic or they themselves can not explain the discrepancy properly and instead use excuse hand down to them from either their pastor or teacher but anyhow onto the review i be a decent fan of ghost hunter and when i hear this show be come soon i be pretty excited and think it have some potential as much a i like watch ghost hunter i do not like some of their member and i do not like the way they can dismiss a place a be haunt yet can not explain anything that be go on just because your investigation equipment do not pick it up do not mean the camera film the show do not i be glad they be skeptical but it like they do not understand that just because you do not get anything on your recorder and film do not make the place haunt or not if ghost be that easy to capture it would be know a a fact not a belief it more of a right place at the right time kind of thing as well a if there be something there what make you think it go to perform for you this show be kind of silly it usually boring and there be lot of talk lot of psychic yet hardly anything happen the main guy filter narration be usually either bore to listen to or be basically not needed.also the reliance on psychic be too abundant a i believe very few of them be actually gift silvia brown be one i definitely believe in but most be sometimes hard to believe.i really want to like this show but of the few i have see i have yet to be terribly impressed,positive
for a long time the menagerie be my favorite star trek episode though in recent year it have be eclipse by city on the edge of forever what i use to prefer about menagerie be that it more hardcore star trek with this fascinate backstory to the thencurrent trek storyline i still think it fairly ingenious the way gene roddenberry incorporate the original pilot into a twopart episode though the new part of the story be largely an excuse for kirk and a few others and u to watch the pilot the idea of spock be courtmartialed be a clever one you can poke hole in the plot if you want for instance give the talosians mindcontrol ability and captain pike condition why be it even necessary to physically ing pike back to their planet and there be other confusing question about pike and commodore mendez ... best to not think too hard about the detail and just enjoy sts only twoparter,positive

largely forgettable tale in which mercenary kerman employer agren travel into the jungle in search of agrens miss sister.despite it connection to the cannibal movie family this film be more of an extreme version of rene cardonas guyana crime of the century lenzi clearly aim to exploit the at that time topical jonestown massacre by depict a rogue self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania play with ruthless intensity by ivan rassimov lead his motley crew flock into self inflict oblivion with sister in toe kerman agren attempt to stop the rot but after several fail coup they end up flee into the green inferno only to run afoul the local and their notorious appetites.one in a string of excessive gore fests that emerge in the late seventies/early eighty where every new addition seem to engage in a oneupmanship contest with it predecessor by attempt to contrive the most gory and graphic display ever ought to motion picture this inferior instalment employ all the motif and gimmick of the others but with much less success.was it the so called amazonian native who look like they be bollywood reject this film be make on location in sri lanka or the inept decapitation and castration scene that seriously diminish the authenticity that be apparent in cannibal holocaust you can decide without spoil the conclusion it appear a though lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive end where all loose end be resolve most unsatisfying.as with the others where the extent of the graphic depiction of violence toward human be limit thankfully the filmmaker have spar no extreme in inflict the bad possible cruelty on hapless animal in their pursuit of the most sadistic shock unfortunately the only thing shock about this film be that it rate a mention among others of the ilk that deal with the subject matter more convincingly.if there be any redeemable feature at all kerman be an affable if somewhat onedimensional lead man and his bevy of scantily clad costars agren lai and senatore provide some visual respite from the relentless slaying,negative

if youve read mother night and enjoy it so much a i do that you just have to see the movie understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of vonnguts write that beyond his story lie vonnegut himself and that you cant put a human mind on the screen his whit and humor just can not be transcribe by a screenplay or even the best acting performance i believe that this movie exceed in ask the key question that vonnegut pose in his book but those frequent cynical moment of satire find on the page be not find on the screen do this mean that the movie miss the mark of course not in my opinion the movie succeed because it do not try to recreate the experience of read the book this be not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page it succeed because it take the fundamental element of a story create by one of america true artistic treasure and present it in a a framework without pretense ive see other movie version of vonnegut book where the director obviously try to channel vonnegut genius and lose grip on his own craft i would not place this movie a one of the best ive see but it stand on it own leg a one well worth watch by take vonneguts voice out of the movie narration or try to insert it however it can mother night tell his story illiantly and preserve the storys fundamental lesson without confusion distraction or disappointment,positive
this be one of the bad movie ive ever see not only that it be a comedy which isnt funny but it also very badly make with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screen and other effects.the two hero with their fantasy language be just annoy and it confuse me quite a lot that they touch each others genitals all the time but the bad of all that nonsense be the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal by refer to german history and to show sensitive aspect of the hero which find it climax in show how erkan and stefan cure a mentally ill woman with their joyful lifestyle but i hadnt expect anything good by director michael bully herbig who also make two not funny tvshows a not funny western movie and a nearly not funny sfcomedy movie but erkan and stefan have be just a little well in some of their standup program for me the only good thing about the movie be alexandra neldel who be very beautiful to me,negative

a number of contributor have mention the age difference between stewart and novak she be and he be when this movie be release i think that the difference didnt matter for a suspense drama like vertigo but it do matter for a romantic comedy we can easily understand that be why his character would be attract to hers but it less clear why hers would be attract to his.still the movie work a a light romantic fantasy the scene where she star at him across the cat head with her dark paintedon eyeows flare and the sound of her humming and the cat purring be true magic it a little jarring therefore when the scene shift to the top of the flatiron building and we see the age difference very sharply a he emaces her she reach up to run her finger through his hair but stop that motion and just ushes her fingertip lightly against his toupee,positive

the only conceivable flaw of this film be it title please stop compare it to the first i do in my previous review only to separate it from the first if you havent see the movie and be curious totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this there be nothing alike and have a mood all it own this be a great exponent of screwy mids comedy i seriously doubt such big name in this cast do the movie because they be oke or even want to remake the first anybody who ever want to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus i maintain the only reason this be in the imdb bottom be because of it title i usually hate movie like these i.e adam sandler will farrell farrelly os .... but this movie just keep me laugh hysterically i dunno maybe it like a bad relationship i cant get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure either way this be the single most underrated movie of the s behind the stunt man.robert stack we love you,positive

only light spoiler in here steal sinatra be a halfslapstick comedy about dimwit kidnapper dimwit victim and a few other sidestories throw in to eat up some time.you will see some poor performance all around in this movie the drama be force and the humor make no sense whether youre watch the kidnapper threaten the victim who wont shut up or a victim father respond to the criminal death threat with care for some tea none of it be believable this quite comfortably fit into the wannabe movie category.you will also be listen to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie it quite unprofessional and add nothing it really just a sad attempt at make an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty.however if youre able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief you might be entertain by the adequate storyline.i vote,negative
yes this be one of those movie so terrible so insipid so trite that you will not be able to stop laughing i have watch comedy good comedy and laugh less than my wife and i laugh at this movie the other comment give the idea well enough the character be so unpleasant you cheer the rat on the effect be so poorly do you wonder whose elementary school art class be in charge the act oh the acting talk about tired dialogue and embarrass pauses.but the rat yes the big rat why we didnt get to see the rat until the end rather surprise me often the big one isnt show until the end because the budget be limited and good effect chew up so much money i surmise however that in this case the big rat be hide until the end because the filmmaker be ashamed that the best they have be a guy run around dress up like a woodchuck with thirdworld dentistry.the most sublime part of the whole movie be the elevator scene after figure out that the rat couldnt stand loud noise migraine from the bad act the main dude rig up a fire alarm to send the rat into a frenzy if youve ever want to see a pair of rat waltz while blood squirt out of their head like a geyser this film be for you really you need to rent it and see for yourself.but not for more than â¢ ok,positive

follow directly from where the story leave off in part one the second half which set about tell the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man legacy be exactly a such in direct contrast to the first feature part two represent a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country to cheâ—struggling liberator of a country to which he have no previous tie the change of set isnt just aesthetic from the autumn and spring grey of the woodland come a change of tone and heart to the feature replace the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical battered and uised reality align to an all new struggle yet a che would go on to say himselfâ—such a struggle be best told exactly a thatâ—a struggle while part one certainly help document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquire through just that part two take a much more refined callous and bleak segment of ches life and ambition and give it an assertive portrayal that be both poignant and tragic in a tangible easy to grasp manner.while the movie tone in some regard do stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however there still remain that same document approach take a month ago that avoids melodrama and faication as much a possible this somewhat distant cold approach to tell ches story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewer off indeed i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have be name after one manâ—if anything the entirety of che take a a whole delivers a tale that go beyond mere biography and instead document a man struggle alongside those who help carry him along the way by no mean do soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel do with der untergang half a decade ago excuse the ironic contrast che be a slow moving reserve and meditative approach to tell a history lesson that just happen to be narrate by the one man who â–arguably conduct the whole thing.yet by move from the lush green landscape of cuba and retreat to the bleak decay backdrop of bolivia for part two the story do inevitably take on a distinctly contrast tone that doesnt feel too disjoint from it predecessor but do enough to give it it own reference point here the basic structure of part one be echo backâ—theres the initial struggle the battle the fall comrade and the recruiting of those to replace them all the while we see some glimpse of the man behind the movement yet a anyone with the vague idea of the actual history behind the feature will know part two be destine to end on a much more underwhelming and disquiet note this difference in combination with the similarity to part one make a compelling and memorable whole by all mean both could be digest one their own and kudos to soderbergh for achieve a such and enjoy a they be but take a one statement che delivers exactly what it set out to achieve.indeed everything that make part one the treat that it be one month prior be still evident here from the subtle yet engross performance from the central cast to the slow building realistically structure combat scenesâ—the drama inherent to the character on screen be just a vague and indiscernible but with a feature such a this part two once again prove that avoid such element dont necessarily hurt a film when there be enough plot and reflection on other element to keep the viewer engage in fact upon write this review i be at odds a to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for part one and title the review a a whole yet i felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both film consecutively.with that say i can not rightfully decree whether or not che hold up to the task of engage an audience for it sprawl four hour plus runtime but upon view both segment i can at least attest to each part ability to do just that with a reflective intricate screenplay combine with endlessly mesmerise photography and nuanced performance that do justice to the movie character without draw attention to themselves che part two be every bit a compelling and rewarding a it predecessor but this time with a tragic but uplifting reaffirming conclusion fit for the history page of film a review by jamie robert ward http //www.invocus.net,positive

i know little or nothing about astronomy but nevertheless i be at first a little sceptical about the plot of this movie it follow three child that be all bear during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion and thus naturally become ruthless serial killer the plot do sound ridiculous at first but once you realise that a solar eclipse block out saturn and a you know saturn be the emotion planet it all fall into place make complete sense and it then that you know you arent simply watch another silly s slasher with a pea ain plot thank god for that seriously though bloody birthday be base on a ridiculous premise but it more than make up for that with it originality have a bunch of kid go round slaughter people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever see in cinema but when give the choice between this and another dull friday the th clone i know what id choose.also help the film out of the hole that some people would think it silly plot dug it into be the fact that it extremely entertaining many slasher become formulaic far too quickly and the audience end up watch simply to see some gore this film however keep itself go with some great creepy performance from the kid which hark back to creepy kid classic such a village of the damn a constant stream of sick humour and a small but impressive for the type of film dose of suspense and tension one thing that i like a lot about this movie be the vast array of weaponry there nothing bad than a slasher where the killer use the same weapon over and over again cough halloween cough but thats not the case here a bloody birthday find room for everything from skip rope to bow and arrows there wasnt any room for a chainsaw which be a huge shame but i suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it,negative
after many many year i saw again this beautiful love story think about how would i half a century after react to a film which make so many girl cry and sigh at that time when i be just an male adolescent try to understand woman behavior in a small city in brazil.this time however what catch my attention in the film be something very different namely the insistence with which the physician dr. han suyin jennifer jones make clear to the journalist mark elliott william holden her special ethically condition a an eurasian in fact she be constantly put emphasis on this point in their relationship repeat she be willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a occidental way provide that by do so she be not betray her chinese side it seem to the spectator that suyin be eagerly make effort to establish a very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspect of her culture for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempt to control them.therefore suyins attitude always leave poor elliott â– a determine ave and extremely practical man â– anxious and perplexed without know how much importance to give to her word for him whose love for her be plain and simple the situation be totally clear if we love each other let u make a couple and begin immediately a life together not so fast be what she seem verbally and nonverbally to answer him all the time.in fact suyins chinese portion would never allow her such a level of pragmatism and a she go on and on reinforce this much aim equiliium between those two world inside herself she also frequently signal to him that also a very peculiar trait of chinese culture be deeply root in her mind namely the constant raid on the real world by invisible being from an spiritual or nonphysical world for suyin be always alert elliott about how dangerous be life not because of any objective and concrete threat a would be the perpetuation of the english colonialism or the eminence of a japanese invasion but due to the threat of plenty of cruel and harmful god and other mystical and mythical being over the poor fearful and vulnerable human beings.in fact it look like a whole bunch of chinese deity be permanently on the watch to make people life totally miserable because of that mother must dress their precious male baby in girl clothes so that they be not take away by jealous god everyone should always be ready to make loud noise to send the cloud away in order to avoid their cover the sight of the moon peasant be advise that they should shout loudly the rice be bad the rice be bad to protect their crop from be steal by deity and in a funeral it be recommend that the dead family be isolate from the other people by curtain so that the god dont take advantage of their sorrow and fragility.in other word suyin introduces u to a culture in which the supernatural have a real existence a if a rather disturb pantheon of malign and sadistic god be always on the verge of negatively interfere with the most banal act in anyones daily life.as the story take place in hong kong in it should be clear that china really be at that time almost a semifeudal society while the country from which elliott have come from be not yet dominate by the fierce capitalism that launch by the usa after the first oil shock in take charge of the whole world therefore at least in one aspect both side of suyins eurasian personality be still much more innocent than they would be today.a lot of history come into be since those old day a to china the main fact be that after several phase of a communist regime the country finally reach in the last two decade the condition of a very aggressive economy much more properly describe a state capitalism and what happen to that old spirituality that so much enthral suyin in hong kong in and with which she use to impress so much an impassioned elliott under that tree on the hill behind the hospital it be go completely go in ief if that story take place today elliott would not find it necessary to go to china to propose to suyin in the presence of the third uncle and her entire family in fact both men would now be incomparably closer to one another in their huge pragmatism talk business a usual,negative
first and foremost i would like to say that before i watch this film i consider myself an accept individual someone that care about others appreciate others found no/barely any judgment against other people and this film have i think change my life or viewpoint dramatically when i watch it i didnt know particularly what it be about i know it be about some type of forbidden relationship but other then that i be clueless and a i begin to see what be take place between these two wonderfully depicted character i be in shock disbelief confusion and surprise the first time i watch it i be blind blind to their love to their intimacy to their connection to their pureness a human being to their relationship i watch it a second time because i finally figure out how hypocritical i be be say to myself and others oh i accept all type of people and try not to judge them while still judge this wonderful and amazingly insightful story because of my fear i suppose the second time i watch this film i open those eye of mine that have stay close the first time and really look not at the type of taboo relationship part that id hear about all my life but simply at two human being in love and i love it i love the storyline i love the slightly oken yet strong individual people in the film i love the sharing of feeling and i love the strong bond create it be a really eye open beautifully do film that make me cry at time and i hope that people who read this and be go to watch the film eventually remember that everyone deserve love no matter what shape or form it be present in ....,positive

the screenplay be the bad part of this film a it lurch from one premise to the next miss all the important bit that would have make a number of different story possible this film be confuse because the audience doesnt know what the story be i have no problem with the lowproduction value and the act wasnt great but this be telly so it be fine i dont mind if some scene look like they be do in one take but have such a nonsensical screenplay be completely unnecessary do any executive actually read it before fork out the cash avoid this at all costs.the prologue in particular be so poorly write it need a voiceover to fill in all the detail that have be leave out the prologue be rush it wasnt clear what be happen ie the russian revolution be reduce to some riot be happen in petersburg with the next scene be soldier arrest them i know the basic history of the revolution so i could fill in the detail those pesky communists the prologue be best ignored.this could have be a thoughtful study of a person who be confuse about who she be it set up this premise in the asylum it could then have her struggle to identify herself for the rest of the film no go the film assume she be who she say she be even though there be still no empirical evidence it set up a melodramatic romance a love so strong itll believe anything she say okay a soppy romance no because it make no sense the love interest seem like a crazed and incidentally sleazy lunatic burst out in wild gesture this also doesnt work because the film stupidly decide to tell the truth in the monologue at the end they never get married and she return to america the love story collapse despite there be plenty of love scene i be never convince of the reason that they be in love i find romcom romance more convincing despite there only be one or two scene which establish that theyve even spend any time with each other.it could have be a thrillertype thing where the film assume she be who she say she be and she struggle to prove her identity no the court case be sum up rather than deal with the bizarre voice over come back again to fill in the detail of a good film.the funny thing to consider be what really happen anna anderson be a loony who go to america and marry another loony and they do crazy thing together throughout her life she have bout of lunatic behaviour none of this in the film either theres a really annoying character in the asylum who crop up from nowhere and announce herself a a one flew over the cuckoos next/twelve monkeystype informant thankfully she vanish have ought nothing to the story,positive

wow whats this on the video rental store shelf in front of me nothing other than a questionable sequel to mm it wasnt a very good sequel to a movie that have a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far great than this movie.basically from the plot outline verbatim an american diplomat david huxley and his fiancã©e tish harrington venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in budapest hungary to find out who be blackmail them with a porno video take of them with a prostitute risa the entire story be base around the various character who make up these various sex club and strip joint throughout the city the mystery be solve when in the end tish find out that the ransom money for the video and essentially later on in the story her fiancã©e which come out of her trust fund money be basically go back to her future husband a the story unfold til the bitter end.i didnt like how this have nothing to do with the original mm at all the only thing close to the original be the type of thriller that it be the fact that david end up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner look like the kinky world of the first film and the fact that the entire movie have sex emblazon throughout almost every key scene otherwise it a totally different movie it make for a lousy love story even before the end be know which make the end more of a possibility because i didnt believe the word come out of david mouth the whole time but we be warn that he be a liar about most thing that might get him in trouble.there be ridiculous nude scene in most of the shock moment of the film which be try to stir emotion in the audience to cheer for tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this hellish sex debauchery i count at least ridiculously film sequence when there be nothing but sex to be show even the menu screen on the dvd be nothing but film with naked woman on it to make the dvd seem totally provocative.david be no heroic person throughout the film you could guess he be the main problem long before the end the actor who play each role be all new to me which might explain how they get so many of them to strip down to gain act respect there be plot hole how do david and richard finally impress tishs father by get the lease they want when david be so wrap up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute there be cheesy technology moment like the talk email program dress up like a bondage queen and a gay other character which do nothing but show how the director be try to get a joaquin phoenix knockoff to play this character the tag line feature on this profile for this video be complete bs too because it wasnt even about a last eath nobody really die but they do have a good car crash sequence that come out of nowhere ... but that be a good second long out of an hour and long movie.go rent and maybe buy the original it one of joel schumachers well and more original film it have everything well about it from this film i wouldnt recommend see this unless you want to compare apple to orange,negative

this episode have potential the basic premise of a woman live next door to an empty apartment but a phone that constantly ring be somewhat interesting and when she explore the noise there be genuine tension and fear but stupid script write ruin any promise the episode had.first of all the woman readily admit to see thing that would send most of u run in the other direction e.g it funny that the door slam shut even though there be no wind this door have serious damage to it that wasnt here a minute ago the door open by itself without me touch it etc. give these supernatural phenomenon plus the fact that a woman commit suicide in the room wouldnt she take some precaution before enter it maybe she could investigate in the day time or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else or maybe she could turn on the light also while in the haunted apartment she decide to make numerous phone call to the operator and get into an argument over who have the power to disconnect the phone and then they begin discuss the detail of the suicide just unplug the phone the phone company doesnt need to be involve walk up to the phone and unplug it case closed.finally show the phone scamper across the floor like it alive be just comical if the director want the woman to get strangle by the phone card he couldve do it in a way that didnt look cartoony brave little toaster anyone,negative

the film someone have to make.waco the rule of engagement dissect the evidence behind the standoff in waco texas that lead to the destruction of the branch davidian homestead and the alleged government coverup.the first thing you need to know about this film you will see ief but disturb photo of the victim body this be not do for shock value but to illustrate point about the way they die a if you be present at the coroner inquest.the second thing you should know about this film at two and a quarter hour it pretty ponderous especially if you already follow the event closely at the time if you be unaware of any of the event other than what be report in the mass medium or if the only side of the story you be familiar with be the official government report this may be essential view if on the other hand you want a more concise albeit unapologetically one side version of event you should see waco the big lie.in summary this be pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event and be very sobering but a a work of filmmaking could test your patience especially if you have a short attention span and it at time superfluous for those who watch the cspan hearing and the minute reports.perhaps someday someone will make a documentary that cover some of the stranger aspect of this story such a the bizarre chain of event that lead up to the atf raid or the psychological warfare tactic the fbi use blast rock music at the sect and their charismatic leader all rock musician themselves pick up their instrument and turn their massive amplifier outward to blast their own music right back at them,negative

yes it be a bit cheesy but it suspenseful and entertaining and one of my favorite there be some excellent actor in the film and they do a commendable job give the limitation of plot and character it interesting to see david soul in a bad guy role i think he be quite believableand rather chillingas the evermoreparanoid co. robert conrad be a longtime favoritei think he ings his character to life very well and sam waterston have be star quality in everything of his ive watchedmovies or tv i watch this movie every so often but our tape a vhs tv copy i get be such poor quality it difficult to fully enjoy it this be a movie i think they should put out on dvd maybe it wouldnt be universally seek after but im sure there be lot of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there would be a market for a dvd version ill keep hoping,positive
so it isnt an epic but for people experience anything similar sibling suicide it might be an interesting way of therapy animaginative narrative and some fine acting make it time wellspent for some reason it hasnt really catch on in the audiencesomething i do believe be a result of the main theme why do shecommit suicide clearly this be hardly something that usmoviegoers will flock to have it be an european production itprobably would have reach it audience in a much greaterextent it be however a movie that although the realism taint by ashimmering romanticize glow give the viewer a whole heartedimpression,negative

criticism do mention spoiler i rarely make user comment but this be one movie i have no problem slander this movie stink and it mediocre of rating of and a half star be probably too high for such pulp the bone collector be not at all the same calie of film that silence of the lamb or seven be despite what it ad claim this be a perfect example of how not to make a thriller the pace of this movie be extremely slow i actually leave for about minute halfway through and come back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression i refer to you the part where angelina jolies character debate denzel about cut off a corpse hand the movie be not at all scary but try to compensate this with a lovesubplot albeit sexy angelina jolies character and denzel washington of course what you get be something comparable to that of the mentorstudent relationship a see in the illian epic silence of the lamb with hannibal lecter and starling however even this lack all effectiveness and i be personally rout for the villain to kill denzel off so a to avoid hackneyed giggle between the two with such a crappy movie i be halfexpecting a plottwist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit thing that mediocre movie like arlington road and scream pull off anybody with a th grade education can see the end how will be resolve a situation which mimicks alfred hitchcock rear window the cliche of have the killer explain his motif be uninspired enough but the reason be so ridiculous and stupid it have me spew latte over the screen esoterically speak i even think the murderer intention be completely lose a denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial chess game and get with his pet project angelina.if you be a fan of movie with original idea and genuinely dynamic concept like i be you will not appreciate this film if you have not attend a single movie in your life and would like to catchup on every single hollywood cliche ever bear the latenight knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer the ridiculous serialkiller to prime investigator relationship the horrible woman try to get by in an allmale dominate workforce aka sotl see this movie .... but even then it too slowpaced and youd be bore,negative

formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich chilenian who stand to inherit a fortune and get mixed up in the affair of bad guy and fall in love with a beautiful female lawyer vargas it look very much like a tv movie not really excite the only reason i bother to see it be because valentina vargas be in it no real surprise here though it be nice to see vargas great look chilenian landscape on display but malcolm mcdowells part be very small and doesnt add much to the movie michael ironside play a usual a bad guy but this be not one of his most memorable part the chase scene be standard fare,positive
whatever rating i give boom be only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome otherwise this be only for hardcore addict of elizabeth taylor her downward phase and richard burton his miscast phase tennessee williams write the milk train doesnt stop here anymore and be suppose to be very fond of this adaptation of his playbut apparently he be the only one taylor reportedly hat it and burton need the money.whatever it amount to a hill of bean with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner explode at the servant and exchange bad babytalk with no less than noel coward who seem to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears.its so campy that among taylor fan it probably consider a must see kind of thing but if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand youre way ahead of me sadly this be the film that signify the end of taylor be take seriously a a film actress even after win two oscar for burton it be equally disastrous and the critic call it a bomb judge for yourself if you dare,negative
viva la bam this jackass spin off focus on the obviously scripted adventure of bam margera and his pal johnny knoxville brandon dicamillo etc this show while it have it fair share of grossout comedy and crazy stunt focus mainly on bam torture of his parents.im sorry to say this bam but ... youre in no way as cool a you think you be this ego trip show be not only painfully unfunny and yes i like jackass but also narcissistic beyond belief the overly stylize intro end with bam coolly explain that hes go to do whatever the f he want to how about you do something that be actually funny i like jackass for what it be worth the camerawork be horrible any idiot could have make a good show with a camcorder in their parent garage but at least the show move at a steady pace and never felt bore between the crazy dangerous or simply disgust stunt the pal performed.not so with viva la bam we follow our hero around a he play prank on his friend and torture his relative but never do it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy the stunt and prank be mildly entertaining but present in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile.viva la bam be a poor spinoff of that do little good but feed margeras already too big ego i dont recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone,negative
i have never hear of larry fessenden before but judge by this effort into write and direct he should keep his day job a a journeyman actor like many others on here i dont know how to categorize this film it wasnt scary or spooky so cant be call a horror the plot be so wafer thin it cant be a drama there be no suspense so it cant be a thriller it just a bad film that you should only see if you be a fan of the blair witch project people who like this film use word like ambiguity and complex and subtle but they be read into something that wasnt there like the blair witch people get scared because people assume they should be scar and buy into some guff that it be terrify this movie actually start off well with the family meet the local after hit a deer it look like be a modern day deliverance but then for the next minute well over half the film nothing happen the family pot about their holiday home which be all very nice and dandy but not the slight bit entertain it be obvious the local would be involve in some way at some stage but essendon clearly have no idea how to build suspense in a movie finally when something do happen it not even clear how the father be shot how he die the nurse say his liver be only grazed and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently track down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with rd grade special effect the film be call wendigo but no attempt be make to explain it in any clear way the film end all muddle and leave you very unsatisfied i would have bail out with minute to go but i want to see if this movie could redeem itself it didnt,positive

this be one of the fine film to come out of hong kongs new wave that begin with tsui harks zu warrior of magic mountain tsui set a tone for the new wave approach to the martial art film that pretty much all the director of the new wave jackie chan sammo hung wong jing ching siu tung etc accept from then on a a give namely the approach to such film thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony if not outright comedy burn paradise put a stop to all that and with a vengeance.its not that there isnt humor here but it be a purely human humor a with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manage a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hide in a bundle of straw but this be just a human be not even buddhist priest can be saint all the time.when irony be at last introduce into the film it be the nasty possible emanate from the abbot of red lotus temple who be a study in pure nihilism such a have never be record on film before he be the very incarnation of milton satan from paradise lose well to rule in hell than serve in heaven and if he cant get to satan hell soon enough hell turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule.thats the motif underscore the utal violence of much of the imagery here it not that the abbot just want to kill people he want them to despair to feel utterly hopeless to accept his nihilism a allencompassing reality thus theres a definite sense pervade the red temple scene that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself it have become all there be to the universe and the abbot claim mastery of infinite power be in charge.of course fortunately the film doesnt end there though there be loss the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails if you want to know how see the film yet there be no doubt that in view this film we visit hell hopefully we do not witness our own afterlives but we certainly feel chasten by the experience and somehow well for it over all,negative

i dunno sometimes ... you try and try and try to be charitable towards all the b thru z grade movie out there but once in a while a particular movie just test your patience until you want to slap everyone involve bat people which i saw under the title it live by night be just such a movie you cant watch this without think that it really should have be an episode on night gallery and not one of the good one either the movie have something to do with a doctor who get bite by a bat and consequently start to morph into a werebat who drink human blood actually youd think if he be turn into a real bat hed be eat mosquito by the gallon bucket but because this be a cheap lurid horror movie blood the word in spite of the fact that he have grandmal seizure at the drop of a hat and blackout episode almost every night his friend and fellow physician dr. mustache aspenextreme insist that he just have an allergic reaction to the rabies shots meanwhile the world most obnoxious and stereotype county sheriff suspect the doc of be responsible for the utal murder and exsanguination of several local girl and one wino also meanwhile the doctor wife decide that denial be a river in egypt and alternately patronize him and nag him to distraction it not so much that the acting be bad you can tell that the actor be make professional level choice and be try to ing some juice and life to the script even the guy who play the sheriff okay it be pretty bad but it bad in a clichã©d wooden professional way it just that everything about the act the way the scene be pace the costume the dialog the script and the story line in general set your teeth on edge and make you want to well slap everyone involved.i think the movie have an outside chance at be a spooky unsettling little cult favorite but the director need to beat michael pataki an experienced character actor with a chair until pataki agree to act and not just channel dennis weaver he also need to find a script that make a little more sense with regard to the whole bat bite human who then turn into a bat scenario he also need the actor who play the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his episode instead of resort to man have a seizure page from the little golden book of clichã©d act mannerism he need to rework the whole wife character make her both more intelligent less shrill and waaaaay more observant i would never voluntarily watch this film again except with the help of mike and the bot it bad but it isnt bad in a silly humorous or interesting way still well than battlefield earth or waterworld though,negative
